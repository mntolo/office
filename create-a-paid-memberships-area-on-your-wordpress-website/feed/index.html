Hi there,
Thanks for your comment; That&#039;s a technical question, I&#039;m afraid that&#039;s not the kind of question we would answer on the blog.
Could you raise a ticket on our support ticket alkaweb.ticksy.com if you&#039;re already a customer?
Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello,
I have a wordpress membership website, and I&#039;m using the Paid Memberships Pro.
How do I customize the login page (I do not like the wp-admin login page), and also, how to remove the
 admin bar from non-admin users so that they cannot change anything on the website like adding or removing any sort of media etc.
My website has a free content and restricted content for paid members.
I want the user to only browse the website and see the content.
Thanks a lot, appreciate your help
