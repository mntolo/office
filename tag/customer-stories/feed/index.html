										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this third customer story we have Mohammad, who uses Woffice for a notable purpose: an <strong>intranet for a government sector</strong>.<br />
In this article you will discover how Woffice and WordPress have helped him to achieve his important goal.</p>
<h2>1. Hello Mohammad, please let us know something about you</h2>
<p>My name is Mohammad and I work in IT Department at government sector in Kuwait. Our department deals with many deal with many huge companies, but unfortunately I cannot provide more details for privacy. I was looking for a simple intranet and I found a lot of solutions with many with different price tags and I preferred Woffice among them.</p>
<h2>2. Why have you chosen Woffice to build your intranet?</h2>
<p>I didn’t find anything good for the eye, beautiful and customizable at the same time like W<span class="il">office</span>. We need the employees to enjoy the work and I believe the interface is one of the main things that allow the users to be excited to use it. Plus there is no monthly payment per user or anything like that.</p>
<h2>3. Did you find in <span class="il">Woffice</span> what you were looking for?</h2>
<p><span class="il">Woffice</span> gave me almost everything I need in an intranet. It help as managing all the users and keeping an eye for the next goals. And it help the users to find each other using the Member directory. It helps to manage the users easily by giving them tasks in the projects so the work will be arranged and sorted in each department and section.</p>
<h2>4. What is the feature in Woffice that you definitely prefer and that helped more than any other one?</h2>
<p>Projects is the best feature in <span class="il">Woffice</span>, it’s not perfect yet but so useful. The manager can check all the departments’ projects in a single page and see the timeline for each department. So he can keep an eye for the whole work in a click.</p>
<h2>5. In your opinion, is <span class="il">Woffice</span> easy enough to use for a beginner?</h2>
<p><span class="il">Woffice</span> is easy for anyone with 0 code experience. It have a lot of functions that you can customized it for months. I had many problems at the beginning but support team has helped me to solve them quickly.  You can mange to build a great intranet for any huge organization.</p>
<h2>6. What is the most useful plugin for your application?</h2>
<p>The Pro event is one of the best plugin in W<span class="il">office</span>. We are using it for many things. Viewing and Booking a halls. Also posting an events for the internal employees with the ability to use each event as a single page. Plus we can know how many persons are going to attend with the booking feature.</p>
<h2>7. Why did you picked WordPress to build your intranet?</h2>
<p>I chose WordPress because I have tried it before and using WordPress is easy and not expensive at all.</p>
<h2>8. Is there something that you would say to Alkaweb team or to the future Woffice customers</h2>
<p>If you want to use a beautiful Intranet, customizable, easy to use, and without monthly fees. <span class="il">Woffice</span> is what you are looking for.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s Antonio again. Thank you so much Mohammad for your kind words, replies like these make our day!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally, we have a second story for our set of customer stories (if you missed the first one, you can find it <a href="http://alka-web.com/alka-web-com/customers-stories-1-consulting-in-the-area-of-digital-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>). This time is the turn of Edward A. Rodriguez, an entrepreneur from Florida (USA)<em>. </em>Edward is an international speaker and coach in the self-empowerment business. He helped thousands of people to change their lives and to improve their results.<br />
In this article you will discover how  Woffice has helped him and his business.</p>
<h2>1. Hi Edward, can you talk us about yourself and your business?</h2>
<p>My name is Edward, Transformational Trainer, Life Coach, Author and founder of the In-powerment Center.<br />
Our main website is <a href="https://edwardrodriguez.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">www.EdwardRodriguez.com</a> and our members site: <a href="http://miembros.edwardrodriguez.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">miembros.edwardrodriguez.com</a><br />
In an effort to reduce my traveling and at the same time satisfy our growing international demand for our transformational programs (personal development, time management, personal leadership, public speaking, sales etc), we decided to create a membership site to deliver our digital program and courses.</p>
<h2>2. Why have you chosen Woffice to build your application?</h2>
<p>On one occasion I saw a colleague of mine using Woffice and I liked it right away. When I am about to make a decision, I tend not NOT go with “love at first sight”, because of this, my team did an extensive research around creating a website suitable for creating a great learning experience for members.<br />
There are so many options out there, and the one that we kept coming back to was Woffice for its simplicity, and also because it is, in a way, a system. We did not have to do much. All we had to do was to personalize it to our liking. It comes packaged with different features and plugins to help create a private learning, communicating and interacting environment suitable for exactly what we wanted to create for our members.</p>
<h2>3. Has Woffice respected the expectations?</h2>
<p>Since our members website is primarily for e-learning courses, we needed to add the LearnDash plugin. It so happens that Woffice comes with LearnDash integration &#8220;out of the box”. Our team did not like the LearnDash default look and feel. Woffice has styled our Learndash courses beautifully and with no effort and without spending thousands of dollars.<br />
Because Woffice also integrates with BuddyPress, this means, that not only we have our professional looking courses, we can also create a social learning environment for our members…..all out of the box.<br />
We can not have asked for more. Not only we have saved time, but countless hours of custom designing a members website we feel proud of.</p>
<h2>4. What is the feature in Woffice that you definitely prefer and that helped more than any other one?</h2>
<p>If in real estate all is about location, location and again location, for me and our team, when it come to an application, everything is about tech support, tech support and again tech support. Needles to say, Woffice is features rich and I have mentioned all we like about it above, but without their top-notch tech support team, we would have already gone elsewhere.<br />
Woffice tech support team is reliable, prompt and present and it has gone way beyond the norm to make sure that any challenge we face, it is rapidly addressed.</p>
<h2>5. What is the most useful plugin for your application?</h2>
<p>As I told earlier, LearnDash is the most important plugin for me.</p>
<h2>6. Is Woffice easy enough to use for a beginner?</h2>
<p>Since Woffice is a what I call a “package” application with a whole set of solutions, it is great for beginners. Everything comes already “assembled” with easy to choose features. I think it will take hours and hours, a lot of money, effort and headaches for a beginner to get what Woffice offers out of the box. In a way, it was built for beginners and a delight to those more advance because it makes their job so easy.</p>
<h2>7. There is a specific reason behind the decision to pick WordPress to build your web app?</h2>
<p>Yes there is and that’s an easy one. WordPress is a very flexible platform. When I am traveling, oftentimes I come up with ideas that I want to see “live” now and rather than delegating that, I do it right there. WordPress, being so flexible, allows me to do that. It has thousands and thousands of plugins which help you accomplish virtually anything you want on a website. Another thing is the ability to have a professional website along with blogging capabilities built in. WordPress is that and more.</p>
<h2>8. Before than you go, is there something that you would say to the Alkaweb team or to their customers?</h2>
<p>To the Alkaweb team: Congratulations! You have built a masterpiece that is allowing organizations like mine, to create a custom-private-website in no time while being supported by your top-notch tech team.<br />
To future customers, well, waste no time, we already went through the pain doing the research for you, now all you have to do is to create your pages!!!!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s Antonio again. Well, what I can say? Thank you so much Edward for your kind words,  I hope that Woffice will continue to satisfy you.<br />
To you dear reader, I hope you enjoyed the story of Edward, if you would like to be the next one, or you want share any thought with us, just let me know below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you can see from the ThemeForest page, at the current moment, Woffice counts more than 4200 sales. But we believe even more that the number of the sales it&#8217;s not just a figure, it&#8217;s our customers, real people with real stories. Who have chosen Woffice to achieve their real goals. For this reason we realized that we would love to get more details about our customers and see what they think about Alkaweb and Woffice, so we&#8217;ve decided to collect some of these customer stories and share them with you, with a set of articles entirely dedicated to our customers.<br />
<span id="more-327"></span><br />
We lunched this new set with this first article, dedicated to <strong>Renan Santiago</strong>, a guy that used Woffice to improve his business, consulting in the area of digital communication and TV, but let&#8217;s stop to write and see what Renan have to say.</p>
<h2>1. Hi Renan, please present yourself</h2>
<p>My name is Renan Santiago and I&#8217;m 24 years old. I live in São Paulo, Brazil and started working when I was 14 years old helping the internet company that my mother used to work to achieve good visual communication in Salvador, about 2000 kilometers from São Paulo. I graduated in Computer Management in 2010 and Graphic Design in 2012. My whole life I have always loved the internet and its ability to unite people (when used correctly, haha).<br />
Today I own a company called Santiago.media, where we do business consulting in the area of digital communication and TV. We have several clients from different segments, such as commodities, celebrities, TV channels and companies. A few months ago one of our customers asked us for an easy-to-manage platform to use with their representatives and their employees across Brazil, a place with over 200 million people.</p>
<h2>2. Why have you chosen Woffice to build your application?</h2>
<p>After much research, I realized that it was the tool that best suited my client&#8217;s needs. A complete tool, easy to manage and with impressive support. In addition I&#8217;m more familiar with WordPress, With this platform we managed to solve problems in an easy way and with a bundle of plugins we managed to make it much safer!</p>
<h2>3. Have you found in Woffice what you were looking for?</h2>
<p>Yes. The tasking management tool was crucial to decide. Also, the buddypress integration is awesome. I really like the fact that Woffice is responsive and it&#8217;s beautiful design.</p>
<h2>4. What is the top number one feature in Woffice that you definitely prefer and that helped you during your development, more than any other one?</h2>
<p>It has so much features that can&#8217;t decide the best, but I think that the support team helped me A LOT and made me see that Alkaweb isn&#8217;t like the others. It&#8217;s easy to see how they care for the customers and do their best to every client. (thanks Antonio!)</p>
<h2>5. Is Woffice easy enough to use for a beginner?</h2>
<p>Yes, the documentation is very well explained and anyone with a simple knowledge of internet can use Woffice. And the best thing is to count on the Support Team to take your questions and assist you in any way.</p>
<h2>6. What is the most useful plugin for your application?</h2>
<p>The Buddypress integration and the File Away will help us A LOT!</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>7. There is something that you would say to Alkaweb team or to the future Woffice customers?</h2>
<p>You can count on them. The platform is a success because I&#8217;m sure the team has thought of every detail to satisfy customers from all over the world. I&#8217;m glad to hear that there are companies that take care of customers this way. Thank you, guys!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s Antonio again. I would say thank you so much to Renan to have chosen Woffice and have shared his story. Alkaweb wishes him all the best!<br />
If you have already used Woffice for your business (or if you are still using it) and you would like to share your story, feel free to <a href="http://alka-web.com/alka-web-com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact us</a>.<br />
