										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pop-ups have become standard on WordPress websites.</p>

<p>Need proof?</p>


<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/popups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WordPress directory lists</a>&nbsp;no less than 2,576 pop-up plug-ins.</p>


<p>Yet, <em>smart pop-ups</em>&nbsp;are still far from being a standard.</p>


<p>Remember the last time you landed on a website, just to be displayed a pop-up right away?</p>


<p>In this article, I’ll explain how you can design <em>smart WordPress pop-ups</em>&nbsp;that convert and don’t put off your visitors (<em>yes</em>, it <em>is</em>&nbsp;possible).</p>


<p>In this article, we’ll explain how to:</p>


<ol><li>Set your objectives</li><li>Define your segments</li><li>Find the right wording</li><li>Create your design</li><li>Find <a href="https://wisepops.com/wordpress-pop-up-plug-in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the right pop-up plug-in</a></li></ol>


<p>Without further ado, let&#8217;s dive right in!</p>


<h2>Step 1: Set Your Objectives</h2>


<p>Pop-ups can help you achieve several different&nbsp;things:</p>


<ul><li><strong><a href="https://profitblitz.com/get-more-email-subscribers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grow your email list</a></strong>. On average,&nbsp;our customers triple the number of emails they collect when they implement email pop-ups.</li><li><strong>Collect feedback</strong>. On average,&nbsp;our customers notice a 5.1% feedback rate.</li><li><strong>Push a product or a service</strong>. You can expect a click-through-rate between 2%&nbsp;and 6% for this kind of pop-ups.</li></ul>


<p>In this article, we’ll focus on the main use case: list-building.</p>


<h2>Step 2: Define Your Segments</h2>


<p>Most webmasters create only one&nbsp;pop-up that they display on all pages of their website, no matter what.</p>


<p>That’s a huge mistake. Chances are your visitors are expecting something different from your website.</p>


<p>Let’s take the example of a WordPress blog dedicated to online marketing. The blog covers various themes: &nbsp;SEO, PPC, web design and entrepreneurship.</p>


<p>Some of the visitors find the blog when searching for a SEO topic on Google.</p>


<p>Others come through a link to an article about PPC techniques that someone shared in a Slack channel, etc.</p>


<p>You get the idea, <em>right</em>?</p>


<p>It’s difficult to design a one-size-fits-all pop-up that will appeal to all these different kinds of visitors.</p>


<p>So the first step is to think about your different segments. Personalization&nbsp;is key!</p>


<p>You can define them in terms of:</p>


<ul><li>Page visited</li><li>Category of page visited? (WordPress categories or WordPress tags)</li><li>Devices?</li><li>Traffic source?</li></ul>


<p>Here’s a real-life example on WordPress-powered Skillcrush.com.</p>


<p>When I exit a page in the “Remote work” category, I get this pop-up:</p>


<p>But when I visit an article of the “Tech” category, I get this one:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pasted-image-0-1-1024x683.png" alt="Ultimate Guide WP Popup" class="wp-image-723"/></figure></div>


<p>Defining different segments and displaying pop-ups tailored to them&nbsp;will help you display pop-ups that are most relevant to your audience.</p>


<p><em>The result?</em></p>


<p>You’ll end up collecting more emails.</p>


<h2>Step 3: Identify Your Offer</h2>


<p>I’ve got to tell you the truth.</p>


<p><em>Most of your visitors won’t subscribe to your newsletter just because you ask them</em>. You must present them&nbsp;with&nbsp;a <em>strong</em>&nbsp;<strong>incentive</strong>&nbsp;to join your list.</p>


<p>But don’t worry, there are a few options.</p>


<h3>Promise Awesome Content</h3>


<p>Sometimes it’s enough to explain what kind of newsletters you’ll send and why they’re&nbsp;interesting. Here’s this strategy in action on Nutshell.com.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/nutshell.com_blog_b2b-cold-email-templates_2-1024x505.png" alt="Email popup" class="wp-image-729"/></figure></div>


<h3>Offer Exclusive Content</h3>


<p>Usually called <a href="https://www.optimonk.com/ecommerce-lead-magnets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="a lead magnet (opens in a new tab)">a lead magnet</a>, this strategy consists of giving away an exclusive piece of content in exchange for&nbsp;your visitor’s email.</p>


<p>Here is an example from Pickaweb.co.uk,&nbsp;where subscribers can receive an ebook detailing traffic building strategies.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pickaweb.co_.uk_blog_-1024x505.png" alt="Exclusive content" class="wp-image-725"/></figure></div>


<p>The freebie can be anything from a free ebook, an exclusive training video, a unique email series, a podcast, etc.</p>


<h3>Other Options</h3>


<p>Depending on your business, you can also:</p>


<ul><li>Offer a chance to win something</li><li>Offer an exclusive deal/discount</li><li>Offer a surprise (that could sound weird, but it works!)</li></ul>


<p>This goes without saying: you’ll have to pick a different offer for your different segments.</p>


<h2>Step 4: Find the Right Words</h2>


<p>Now that you’ve identified your segments and the offer that will get them on the hook, it’s time to work on the wording of your pop-up.</p>


<p>Here are a few tips that should help.</p>


<h3>Leverage What You Know About Your Visitors</h3>


<p>Engaging a visitor is easier when you show that your offer is tailored to her.</p>


<p>Here’s an example from Beacon.by. I’m reading an article about lead magnets promotion.&nbsp;The pop-up uses a headline that speaks to me immediately:&nbsp;“Everything You Need to Know About Lead Magnets.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/beacon.by_-1024x486.png" alt="" class="wp-image-727"/></figure></div>


<h3>Get&nbsp;Straight to the Point</h3>


<p><em>Do you know anyone who takes more than 3 seconds to read a modal copy?</em></p>


<p>You’re right, life is too short to read long pop-up copies.</p>


<p>Get&nbsp;straight to the point: focus on what the subscriber will receive and why he should subscribe <em>now</em>. Period.</p>


<p>If you need to include legal terms, make them smaller so that the user can skip them easily.</p>


<p>Here’s a good illustration on Volusion’s blog.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Volusion-popups-1024x621.png" alt="" class="wp-image-731"/></figure></div>


<h3>Use Social Proof</h3>


<p>To convince potential subscribers that your newsletter is the best, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nothing beats social proof</a>.</p>


<p>We love to see we’re not the only one subscribed to a newsletter. It feels even better when we can think that we read the same kind of email as an influencer.</p>


<p>Here’s an example from Inc42 featuring pictures of high-profile startuppers and influencers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/inc42.com_-1024x505.png" alt="" class="wp-image-724"/></figure></div>


<p>And here is one from Hotjar,&nbsp;relying on big numbers to capture potential subscribers’ attention:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pasted-image-0-1024x477.png" alt="" class="wp-image-720"/></figure></div>


<h2>Step 5: Prepare Your Design</h2>


<p>When preparing the design of your WordPress modal, there are a few elements to keep in mind.</p>


<h3>Your Pop-up’s Position</h3>


<p>You don’t have to position your pop-up at the exact center of the screen.</p>


<p>Side modals can perform just as well,&nbsp;and are usually less annoying.</p>


<p><em>Their advantage? </em></p>


<p>As they’re not directly in your visitor’s way, there’s less chance&nbsp;your visitors will want to close them without even reading what they have to offer.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Iterable-1024x605.png" alt="" class="wp-image-726"/></figure></div>


<p><em>A side pop-up on Iterable’s blog</em></p>


<p>Bars can provide a great alternative,&nbsp;too. They’re less intrusive and can be displayed more frequently than lightbox pop-ups or full screen pop-ups.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MailUp-1024x755.png" alt="" class="wp-image-730"/></figure></div>


<p><em>An email bar on MailUp’s WordPress website</em></p>


<h3>Your Visuals</h3>


<p>Their main&nbsp;role&nbsp;is to make your pop-up more appealing while helping drive your users’ attention to your signup fields.</p>


<p>Look at this example from Meetedgar.com. The right picture brings life to the pop-up,&nbsp;while the pose&nbsp;of the woman on the picture drives user’s attention to the email input. Brilliant!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MeetEdgar-1024x506.png" alt="" class="wp-image-721"/></figure></div>


<h3>Your Call-to-Actions</h3>


<p>The only risk with your call-to-actions is if your visitors miss them.</p>


<p>Make sure to choose colors that help your CTA stand out from the rest of your pop-up.</p>


<h3>Mobile Pop-ups</h3>


<p>Mobile pop-up design is specific. Why and how you can design great&nbsp;mobile pop-ups&nbsp;is explained&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infusionsoft.com/business-success-blog/marketing/digital-marketing/mobile-pop-ups" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in </a><a href="https://www.infusionsoft.com/business-success-blog/marketing/digital-marketing/mobile-pop-ups" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an earlier</a><a href="https://www.infusionsoft.com/business-success-blog/marketing/digital-marketing/mobile-pop-ups" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;article</a>.</p>


<h2>Step 6: Find the Right plug-in</h2>


<p>What is the best WordPress pop-up&nbsp;plug-in?</p>


<p>There’s not a simple&nbsp;answer to this&nbsp;question. It all depends on what you need. Here are a few elements to take into consideration before making a decision.</p>


<h3>Integrations</h3>


<p>If you’re collecting emails, that’s probably because you want to contact these people in the&nbsp;near future. <em>Right?</em></p>


<p>One of the first things to check when you choose a pop-up plug-in&nbsp;is whether it integrates with your email marketing solution or not.</p>


<p>If not, it means you’ll have to manually export and import your contacts. And trust me, this limits how soon you are able to contact your subscribers.</p>


<h3>Targeting &amp; Design Features</h3>


<p>This could sound obvious, but it’s not.</p>


<p>There is&nbsp;a wide range of tools. <a href="https://wpbarista.com/pop-up-window-in-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">From tools where you need to create your design in HTML</a>&nbsp;and manually upload it, to tools that offer WYSIWYG design and advanced targeting.</p>


<p>Before choosing your pop-up maker, try to identify where the plug-in&nbsp;you’re checking stands in that regard.</p>


<h3>Pricing</h3>


<p>There are almost as many pricing models as there are pop-up tools.</p>


<p>Beware of plug-ins&nbsp;that claim to be free.</p>


<p>And if you go down the free plug-in&nbsp;road, prefer open-source tools.&nbsp;They’ll limit the chances of&nbsp;introducing&nbsp;a security breach or ads in your website.</p>
