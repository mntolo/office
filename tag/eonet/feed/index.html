										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eonet is the new <strong>community theme</strong> developed by Alkaweb. It has been designed to enhance the user experience of every community site and it is fully integrated with BuddyPress plugin.</p>

<p>Eonet handles members, groups, forums, activity walls, private messaging, friendships, restricted content and much more. </p>


<p>So it can be used to create <strong>any kind of <a href="https://alkalab.com/blog/wordpress-community-theme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="community and membership website (opens in a new tab)">community and membership website</a></strong>, or also a company it website.</p>


<p>If you want to create a professional community with the minimum effort, Eonet is perfect solution for you.</p>


<span id="more-445"></span>


<h2>An Overview of the Eonet Theme</h2>


<p>Eonet is much more than a simple theme, it provides <strong>many unique features</strong> such as a live chat, members map, connections directory, restricted areas, extensions. </p>


<p>The goal was from day 1 to provide a unique experience for both the administrator and the members. </p>


<p>From the administration, everything is <strong>well documented</strong> and the extensive options help you to manage your site as you wish in a matter of seconds. </p>


<p>Then, for the user, we have focused our work on the user interface and how people interact with each other on the network. </p>


<p>We tried to make it easier and more elegant. This work on details can also be found on the responsive version that will let all your members use their favorite community from any place and any device.</p>

<h2>Eonet &amp; Visual Composer: Create Everything without Coding Anything</h2>


<p>Eonet comes with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://codecanyon.net/item/visual-composer-page-builder-for-wordpress/242431?ref=Alkaweb" target="_blank">Bakery Visual Composer</a>, the most famous visual composer plugin for WordPress, in addition to it we have also added the plugin <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://codecanyon.net/item/ultimate-addons-for-visual-composer/6892199?ref=Alkaweb" target="_blank">Ultimate Addons for Visual Composer</a>. </p>


<p>This means that you can choose among dozens of visual elements, combine them and create every page in just a few minutes, using <strong>Drag &amp; Drop</strong> and never touching any CSS or HTML code.</p>


<p>You can see the result of the combination of these plugins in the <a href="https://demos.alka-web.com/eonet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demo Site</a>. We have built the entire website using only these plugins, without the use of any additional code.</p>


<h2>Built-in Features for Eonet</h2>


<p>Here there are just some of the most important features of Eonet, but the list could continues a lot.</p>


<h3>Members Directory<br /><a href="https://alka-web.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/members-page-example.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></h3>

<h3>Members Map &amp; Members Connection Views</h3>


<p>If the standard member&#8217;s page isn&#8217;t enough, we have created two additional page templates: Members Map and Members Connections.</p>


<p>The <strong>Members Map</strong>&nbsp;page displays all members of the site around the world, you can navigate the map and filter the members t display.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moderate new user registrations can be very useful in several WordPress&nbsp;scenarios: <a href="https://alka-web.com/blog/how-to-easily-build-an-intranet-with-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intranets/extranets</a>; e-learning platforms; multi-author blogs; multi-vendor e-commerce site and many others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It can be also a good <strong>protection&nbsp;against spamming accounts</strong>, if the email confirmation isn&#8217;t enough.</p>


<p style="text-align:left">If you are looking for a way to approve or deny manually the registration of your users, you will find a very good solution in this article.</p>


<span id="more-424"></span>


<h2>Eonet Manual User Approve</h2>


<p>Moderation of user registrations isn&#8217;t a feature existing in WordPress by default.</p>


<p>If you don&#8217;t want to use a heavy membership plugin, all the lite solutions already present on the market aren&#8217;t updated or supported anymore. </p>


<p>In addition, some of them was starting to present many annoying bugs. So, due to the increasing requests of our users, we have decided to add a new plugin to our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/eonet/" target="_blank">community suite: <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="6" data-gr-id="6"><g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="6" data-gr-id="6">Eonet</g></g></a>.</p>


<p>The plugin is <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/eonet-manual-user-approve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eonet Manual User Approve</a>.&nbsp;It allows you to manually allow or deny every new user registration on your WordPress site.</p>


<p><em><g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="5" data-gr-id="5">Eonet</g> Manual User Approve</em> is super easy to use and it&#8217;s <strong>very very lite</strong>, it doesn&#8217;t affect your site speed. In addition, it&#8217;s <strong>totally compatible with BuddyPress</strong>, the most famous community plugin for WordPress. </p>


<p>If it isn&#8217;t enough, the plugin allows you to edit the content of all the emails as you prefer, in order to maximize the experience of your users.</p>


<h2>How Eonet Manual User Approve Works</h2>


<p>The plugin creates three statuses: <em>Approved</em>, <em>Pending</em>, <em>Denied</em>. </p>


<p>All new user registrations are set in <em>Pending</em>, and all users registered before the plugin activation are automatically considered as <em>Approved</em>. Only approved users will be able to access <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar replaceWithoutSep" id="6" data-gr-id="6">to</g> your site. Pending and denied users <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace replaceWithoutSep replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">won&#8217;t be able neither</g> to login nor to reset their password.</p>


<p>You can change the status of an user from the Users page in the WordPress dashboard, or from each&nbsp;specific single user page.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://alka-web.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Ritaglio_senza_nome_042717_024237_PM.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://alka-web.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Ritaglio_senza_nome_042717_024237_PM-1024x520.jpg" alt="Approve new user registrations with Eonet Manual User Approve" class="wp-image-429"/></a><figcaption>Users list with Eonet Manual User Approve</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>On the registration page, the plugin displays an alert to inform the user that he has to wait for the manual moderation of an admin. </p>


<p>Once he completes the registration process, an email alert is sent to the admin (this can be disabled) and a new email will be sent to alert the user once the admin will approve or deny him.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-428 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alka-web.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Fotografia_dello_schermo_042717_022542_PM.jpg" alt="Registration page with Eonet Manual User Approve" class="wp-image-428"/><figcaption>Registration page with Eonet Manual User Approve</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>One of the most important features of <em>Eonet Manual User Approve</em> is that it&#8217;s totally compatibly with BuddyPress. The screenshot below is an example of the registration page of BuddyPress using <em>Twenty Seventeen</em> theme:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-431"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alka-web.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Fotografia_dello_schermo_042717_025950_PM.jpg" alt="Registration page with Eonet Manual User Approve and BuddyPress" class="wp-image-431"/><figcaption>Registration page with Eonet Manual User Approve and BuddyPress</figcaption></figure></div>
