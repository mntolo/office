										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the important features to keep an eye out for when picking an Intranet WordPress theme is a calendar widget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A calendar widget has many uses. For one thing, it makes appointment booking possible on your website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, a calendar widget will come in handy when you have an upcoming event and want to remind people about it. This feature will be very useful if you run a project and task management platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there’s still more!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This then begs the question: how do you add a calendar widget to your Intranet site?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Simple. With Woffice theme!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Woffice &#8211; one of the most popular Intranet WordPress themes in the market that sells for only $79 &#8211; comes with a robust, powerful calendar widget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As such, you won’t need another calendar plugin with Woffice in place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this post, I will be showing you how to use this calendar widget. But first, what is a calendar widget used for?</span></p>
<h2><strong>What Is a Calendar Widget Used For?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you run a business or an organization with lots of team members in it, you will agree that maintaining a steady flow of communication is important. This is where setting up an intranet becomes needful &#8211; it helps keep your team talking and, hence, connected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when you’ve finally set up a communication channel via an intranet, the next thing to deal with is the regular stream of events that will follow suit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is where a calendar widget comes into play. It gives you an avenue to set up an event and remind your team members about it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Interestingly, the Woffice calendar widget allows you to customize your events to your heart’s content. </span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Use Woffice Calendar Widget</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here are the steps to using Woffice calendar widget in WordPress</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Step 1: Download and Install Woffice Theme</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To do that, you will need to head over to </span><a href="https://woffice.io/go/theme/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Themeforest and purchase the theme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. After purchasing, download and activate the plugin on your WordPress intranet, just like you would with any other theme</span></p>
<p><a href="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16514" src="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1-1024x303.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="303" srcset="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1-1024x303.jpg 1024w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1-300x89.jpg 300w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1-768x227.jpg 768w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1.jpg 1324w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After downloading the theme from Themeforest, locate the </span><b>woffice-4.0.2 </b><span style="font-weight: 400">zipped file. This is actually the installable file.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you are done with installation and activation, proceed to the next step. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Step 2: Install all Dependent Plugins</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16515" src="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image2-1024x226.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="226" srcset="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image2-1024x226.jpg 1024w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image2-300x66.jpg 300w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image2-768x169.jpg 768w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image2.jpg 1339w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After clicking the link, you will be taken to the plugin installation page. Select all the plugins by simply clicking the </span><b>Plugins </b><span style="font-weight: 400">checkbox. Once you’ve done that, select </span><b>Install </b><span style="font-weight: 400">from the </span><b>Bulk actions </b><span style="font-weight: 400">dropdown box. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With all the plugins selected and bulk action set to install, hit the </span><b>Apply </b><span style="font-weight: 400">button. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon click, all the selected plugins will be installed. Next is to activate them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To do that, navigate to </span><b>Plugins &gt;&gt; Installed Plugins. </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Select all the plugins like you did previously. Then, from the dropdown menu, select </span><b>Activate</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and finally apply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, all dependent plugins have been installed and activated. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Step 3: Add the Calendar Event Extension </em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To begin using the calendar widget on your WordPress intranet, you first need to add the extension. </span></p>

<p><strong><em>Step 4: Add the Calendar Event to Sidebar and Footer</em></strong></p>

<p>It comes packed with every imaginable feature you will need to smoothly manage internal communication and task within your organization.</p>

</ul>
<p>The magic? Woffice allows you to create a separate, customizable login page for your Intranet.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a customized login page without stress.</p>
<p>But first, why do you need a customized login page?</p>
<h2>Why Is a Customizable Login Page Necessary?</h2>
<p>Creating a custom login page for your intranet has a number of benefits.</p>
<p>Firstly, a well-designed login page inspires a sense of security to your users. It puts their mind at rest knowing that their login details are well secured.</p>
<p>In fact, using a separate login page makes it difficult for a user with a malicious motive to gain access.</p>
<p>Secondly, adding your organization’s logo and using custom images helps to improve the user experience. It makes your intranet more welcoming for users.</p>
<p>Lastly, a custom login page makes your organization come off as more professional, both in the eyes of internal employees and external entities that might have access to your portal (extranet).</p>
<p>With all that said, let me now show you how to create one on WordPress</p>
<h2>How to Create and Customize a Login Page Using Woffice?</h2>
<p>Before you proceed to create a custom login page, you need to have an Intranet WordPress theme like Woffice installed.</p>
<h3>How to Install Woffice?</h3>
<h4>Step 1: Download and Upload Woffice to Your Website</h4>
<p>Head over to Theme Forest to purchase the theme. Once you’ve done that, download the purchased theme and log in to your WordPress dashboard.</p>
<p>After doing that, navigate to Appearance &gt;&gt; Themes. Then click the <strong>Add New</strong> button like so:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16206 size-large" src="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image6-1024x286.jpg" alt="Woffice Add Theme" width="1024" height="286" srcset="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image6-1024x286.jpg 1024w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image6-300x84.jpg 300w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image6-768x215.jpg 768w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image6.jpg 1353w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, click the <strong>Upload Theme</strong> button, locate the downloaded Woffice theme (in zipped format), and upload it to your website.</p>
<p><strong>P.S:</strong> When you download Woffice from Themeforest, it often comes in two zipped forms: <strong>Woffice-Intranet.zip</strong> and <strong>woffice-4.0.2.zip</strong>. The latter is installable, the former is not. That is to say, upload woffice-4.0.2.zip and not the first one.</p>
<p>Once you’ve uploaded the Woffice theme, install and activate it. With that done, proceed to step 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2: Install All Dependent Plugins</h4>
<p>For Woffice to function properly, some plugins need to be installed.</p>
<p>But not to worry, you don’t have to manually install these plugins, one at a time. You can do so with few clicks of the button.</p>
<p>Start by clicking the Begin installing plugins link from your WordPress dashboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16205 size-large" src="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image5-1024x226.jpg" alt="Woffice After Install" width="1024" height="226" srcset="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image5-1024x226.jpg 1024w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image5-300x66.jpg 300w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image5-768x169.jpg 768w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image5.jpg 1339w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon click, you will be redirected to the plugin installation page. Here, click the <strong>Plugins</strong> checkbox, and then the <strong>Bulk actions</strong> dropdown box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16204 size-large" src="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image4-1024x458.jpg" alt="Woffice Plugins" width="1024" height="458" srcset="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image4-1024x458.jpg 1024w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image4-300x134.jpg 300w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image4-768x344.jpg 768w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image4.jpg 1158w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then select <strong>Install</strong>, and then hit the <strong>Apply</strong> button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16203 size-large" src="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image3-1024x532.jpg" alt="Woffice Plugins Install" width="1024" height="532" srcset="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image3-1024x532.jpg 1024w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image3-300x156.jpg 300w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image3-768x399.jpg 768w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image3.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon click, all the selected plugins will automatically be installed. At this point, you are ready to start creating your custom login page.</p>
<h3>How to Create a Custom Login Page</h3>
<h4>Step 1: Create a New Page</h4>
<p>Create a new page, like you normally would, and name it whatever you want.</p>
<p>Next, on the right panel, locate the Templates dropdown menu and click on it. Then select Login like so:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16208 size-large" src="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image8-1024x332.jpg" alt="Woffice Login Template select" width="1024" height="332" srcset="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image8-1024x332.jpg 1024w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image8-300x97.jpg 300w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image8-768x249.jpg 768w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image8.jpg 1343w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are done, publish the page. This page will be used by Woffice to set up your login page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2: Customize Your Login Page</h4>
<p>With your login page published, the next thing you will want to do is to style it the way you want.<br />
To do that, navigate to <em>Appearance &gt;&gt; Theme Settings</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16201 size-full" src="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image1.jpg" alt="Woffice Theme Settings" width="563" height="316" srcset="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image1.jpg 563w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image1-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will take you to the Woffice customization page. On that page, click<strong> Login/Register</strong>.</p>
<p>When you’ve done that, toggle the <strong>Custom Login Page</strong> option to <strong>Yep</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image7.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16207 size-large" src="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image7-1024x507.jpg" alt="Woffice Login Options" width="1024" height="507" srcset="https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image7-1024x507.jpg 1024w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image7-300x149.jpg 300w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image7-768x381.jpg 768w, https://woffice.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image7.jpg 1134w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will bring up the login page customization options.</p>
<p>Select your preferred login page layout.</p>
<p>After that, scroll down and make all necessary tweaks that you deem fit. For example, you can choose to set a custom welcome message, use a different background color and image, etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> is a user-friendly CMS that even the first-timers who have never seen any WordPress Admin Panel tutorial before choosing it to power their projects. This is no small measure of the success of the CMS in a highly competitive market that sees new CMS enter very regularly. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>WordPress is renowned for its simplicity and easy-to-use interface. The <a href="https://www.wpblog.com/beginners-overview-of-wordpress-admin-panel-toolbar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress Admin Dashboard</a> allows users to manage their websites easily without writing a single line of code. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In this article, I will explain how to use the admin dashboard and describe each section in detail. </p>
<p><br /><br /><span id="more-1259"></span><br /><br /></p>
<h2>1. WordPress Installation and WordPress Login Page</h2>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In a standard installation, you access the WordPress admin dashboard from the address:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>https://yoursite.com/wp-admin</code></pre>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, it is possible to install WordPress in a directory other than root. In this case, the admin dashboard is accessible from the subfolder address:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>https://yoursite.com/wordpress/wp-admin</code></pre>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When you open your WordPress login page, you have the option of entering your credentials to log into the website. At the end of the page, you have the option of recovering your password and see your website’s URL.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1267" src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image3.png" alt="WordPress admin panel login page" /></figure>
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>2. WordPress Dashboard</h2>
<p><br /></p>
<p>WordPress Dashboard is the nucleus of a website using WordPress. An admin has full access to all sections of WordPress.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Users with other roles, such as Publisher, Contributor, or Author, have limited access to the admin area. Some roles such as Subscribers only have access to their profile page. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>On the dashboard, each main section has a submenu that displays additional options (I’ll discuss them in the Admin Menu section).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1268" src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image8.png" alt="WordPress dashboard overview" /></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Let’s look at each section of the WordPress Dashboard in detail.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dashboard:</strong> offers immediate access to all sections, such as the Dashboard, Articles, Media, Pages, Comments, Appearance, Plugins, Users, Tools, and Settings</li>
<li><strong>Toolbar: </strong>allows quick access to the account, website URL, comments, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Screen Options:</strong> allows you to change what is shown in the admin panel</li>
<li><strong>Help:</strong> show suggestions for the section you are viewing</li>
<li><strong>Customize Your Site:</strong> allows you to customize the front-end elements of your WordPress</li>
<li><strong>At a Glance:</strong> provides details such as the number of articles and pages published, categories and tags used, number of comments left by users. It also shows the active theme, the number of widgets added to the front-end and the current WordPress version.</li>
<li><strong>Quick Draft:</strong> allows you to quickly write an article on the blog.</li>
<li><strong>Activity:</strong> shows you the recent activity performed on your WordPress website.</li>
<li><strong>Recent Comments:</strong> shows the latest comments that users have left on the blog. You can approve, reply, delete, modify or mark the comment as spam directly from here.</li>
<li><strong>WordPress Events and News:</strong> Links that lead to WordPress events particularly WordCamps </li>
<li><strong>WordPress Version:</strong> shows the current version of WordPress.</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>2.1. Toolbar</h2>
<p><br /></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1269" src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image2.png" alt="" /></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From the toolbar, you can access different sections of the admin panel. It also allows you to move directly to the creation of a new post or page.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A small balloon icon displays the number of comments awaiting moderation. Similarly, you can see if any updates are available for the WordPress core, themes, and plugins.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Near the end, you can see the name of the active users and the option to log out of the admin panel. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>WordPress Logo:</strong> leads to the official documentation and the website. </li>
<li><strong>Home Button:</strong> points to the homepage of the website.</li>
<li><strong>Website URL:</strong> shows the URL of the website.</li>
<li><strong>Comments:</strong> shows the number of recent comments and leads to the Comments page.</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> shows a submenu that you can use to create posts and pages. </li>
<li><strong>Account:</strong> shows information about the current user and links to the profile and logout page.</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>2.2. Admin Menu</h2>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The WordPress Admin Panel consists of several sections, each with specific features. The left column is the admin menu. This is a two-level menu where the upper-level element often groups similar options/pages.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The central area of the main page is called Dashboard and contains a series of widgets that provide quick access to the most commonly used functions/features.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<p><br /></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1270" src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image4.png" alt="" /></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The first group of elements of the admin menu contains the items, &#8220;Articles&#8221;, &#8220;Media&#8221;, &#8220;Pages&#8221; and &#8220;Comments&#8221;.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From the Dashboard, you can access &#8220;Updates&#8221;, where you can manage all the updates of the installation, from the CMS version to the installed plugins and themes.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Home:</strong> by default, the main dashboard area displays a general overview of your website and activity, as well as information about upcoming WordPress events and news.</li>
<li><strong>Updates:</strong> displays the latest updates available for your WordPress, plugins, and themes.</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<h3>Posts</h3>
<p><br /></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1271" src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image7.png" alt="" /></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One of the many benefits of the WordPress admin page is that it is extremely easy to publish new pages or articles. In this section, you can choose which posts to show (All, Published, Draft, and Trash).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Moving the mouse over the article name will show the links to manage the articles.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All Posts:</strong> you can see all your content pages or blogs (Publish, Draft, Trash).</li>
<li><strong>Add New:</strong> to create a new blog, click the Add New button from this section.</li>
<li><strong>Categories:</strong> choose from the most used labels or add a new one. </li>

</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p><br /></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1272" src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image5.png" alt="" /></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Your WordPress Admin page provides you with media management, displaying your media library (images, documents, and files).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In this section, you can manage images and files. Hover over the media files and you can see the options for modifying, deleting or viewing the media files. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Library:</strong> You can manage all the image-related information including the alternative text for better SEO. On a side note, for better SEO management, I’d recommend you to install <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoast</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Add New:</strong> You can upload new media files for your pages and posts, individually or in bulk.</li>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Pages are ideal for static content, although you can edit or update them whenever you want. In this section, you can manage and view WordPress pages.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>By hovering the mouse over the page title, you can manage different aspects such as.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All Pages:</strong> to see the pages of your website right now, choose all the pages in the navigation section.</li>
<li><strong>Add New:</strong> adding a new page is very similar to adding a new blog, except you do not have the option to use categories.</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p><br /></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1274" src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image1.png" alt="" /></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In this section, you can manage and view all comments on the website. The comments to be approved are highlighted in yellow and hovering over a comment, you can approve (or mark it as spam.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>You can also reply to the comments or simply delete them. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p><br /></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1275" src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image6.png" alt="WordPress theme" /></figure>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>WordPress offers different tools to help you import articles and media from WordPress or from other platforms (Blogger, Tumblr).</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1279" src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image12.png" alt="" /></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This is where you can make large-scale changes to your entire website. The “Settings” menu provides a series of admin pages that allow you to configure various site features.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The default menu structure is as follows.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>General:</strong> You can change the title and tagline as well as the address of your website (URL). Other settings include email address and time/date format.</li>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Besides, the WordPress API allows developers to add new settings to existing pages.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>3. Wrapping Up</h2>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Using WordPress is really simple, it will take you a few days to discover the main features and up your WordPress admin panel game!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If you are new with WordPress, my advice is to install it on a <a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/wordpress-cloud-hosting.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managed WordPress hosting</a> service, so you don’t have to worry about server management, security settings, backups, etc.</p>

<p>This article is a guest post from the team at Cookiebot. They share their insights into GDPR and how it affects online businesses. This topic is of interest to you, and you have to watch out for this kind of things with your WordPress configuration.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Enjoy.&nbsp;</p>


<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>


<span id="more-1243"></span>


<p>In this post, Cookiebot will clarify the issues between dynamic marketing and GDPR compliance. </p>


<p>First, we’ll take a look at what exactly <em>dynamic marketing </em>is, after which we’ll get into the <em>General Data Protection Regulation</em> (GDPR) and what, specifically, it has to say regarding this particular area of interest.&nbsp;</p>


<p>We’ll look at what <em>consent </em>means in the context of this EU law, and ultimately what it means for your prospects of <em>dynamic marketing</em>. </p>


<h2>What is Dynamic Marketing?</h2>


<p><em>Dynamic marketing</em> is the recording of the activity – the comings and goings – of a website visitor and potential customer, and the use of this information for the purpose of optimizing sales. </p>


<p>It is the tracking of user behavior, potentially down to every click, scroll and hover in order to personalize, push and follow-up on their activity on the website with a targeted advertisement.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/heatmap-1024x702.png" alt="Heatmaps example" class="wp-image-1246"/><figcaption>Heatmaps example</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>So, dynamic marketing relies on an accumulation of data about each user: how they arrive at a website, what they click on, the speed with which they scroll, where their mouse rests and for how long, what they’ve purchased in the past, whether they look at an offer or not and whether they buy it or not. </p>


<p>That’s the <em>dynamic</em> part. </p>


<p>The <em>marketing</em> part is the persistent, personalized and targeted follow-up by the commercial entity with the effort of trying to persuade the visitor to buy what they’ve expressed interest in.</p>


<p>Now, all that dynamic<em> </em>information is actually <strong>personal data</strong>, according to the GDPR.</p>


<p>But what does that mean and what consequences does it have for dynamic marketers?&nbsp;</p>


<h2>What is the GDPR?</h2>


<p>The <em>General Data Protection Regulation </em>came into effect on May 25, 2018, and is binding and uniform law in all EU member states. </p>


<p>Its scope is global in the sense that <em>any </em>website in the world who has a visitor from the EU is bound to be compliant with the GDPR or risk fines up to €20 million or 4% of the company’s annual global turnover, whichever is highest.</p>


<p>So, what does GDPR compliance mean?</p>


<p>Well first off, <strong>personal data </strong>is defined in <strong>Article 4</strong> of the GDPR as <em>“any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person”.&nbsp;</em></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/article4_gdpr.jpg" alt="Article 4 GDPR" class="wp-image-1247"/></figure>


<p>A user’s online behavior, IP-address, e-mail and other information that can identify them after a visit to a website is therefore personal data under the GDPR, even data that in itself is not personal, but that can identify an individual if accumulated and combined with other data. </p>


<p>For example for the purpose of targeted marketing.&nbsp;</p>


<p>This is known as <strong>processing</strong> and is defined, also in <strong>Article 4</strong>, as “any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether<em> by automated means, such as collection, or not.”</em></p>


<p>What this means is that if a website either directly or by means of third party services records, collects, stores, organizes and/or uses any of this data for targeted marketing purposes (as you do in <em>dynamic marketing</em>), you must first obtain <strong>consent </strong>from the user.</p>


<p>The GDPR unambiguously prohibits any processing of personal data<strong> without the prior consent of the user</strong><em> </em>(Article 7)<em>.</em> </p>


<p>This means that none of the behavioral data – clicks, scrolls, past purchases, IP-addresses, geo-location, etc. – is allowed to be harvested, stored and used for marketing purposes, or sold, alternatively, to third-party ad tech companies, without the individual giving their consent – their “okay”.</p>


<p>The GDPR makes it very explicit and pronounced that <em>“consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s agreement to the processing of personal data”</em>.</p>


<p>Last but not least, consent is only real if it can be withdrawn again, and <em>“it shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent”</em>.</p>


<p>So, how is consent obtained?</p>


<h2>GDPR Marketing Checklist: How is Consent Obtained Compliantly?</h2>


<p>Most websites in the world use <em>cookies</em> – small text files installed on a user’s device with the purpose of obtaining information about the visitor. </p>


<p>Some cookies are activated upon arrival on a website, others are activated when a user clicks, scrolls, visits sub-pages and so on.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/alkalab-cookie-1024x527.png" alt="Cookie notice" class="wp-image-1248"/><figcaption><em>Example of cookie notice you receive on Alkalab’s website</em><br /></figcaption></figure>


<p>While some cookies are non-intrusive and necessary for the basic functions of the website, other cookies serve analytical and marketing purposes, allowing third-party trackers to collect personal data for behavioral advertisement and many other purposes, some of which are hidden and obscure.</p>


<p>A website <em>must</em>, according to the GDPR, inform their visitors upon arrival of the cookies and other tracking technology present and operating on their website prior to the setting of all cookies but the strictly necessary. This is typically done in a <em>cookie banner</em> that pops up on the landing page.&nbsp;</p>


<p><em>Illegal</em> cookie banners are banners that do not provide the visitor with any information on the specific cookies, their function, and purpose, nor enables the visitor to consent to – or opt-out of – any cookies apart from the necessary ones.</p>


<p><em>Legal </em>cookie banners, on the other hand, are banners that explicitly and clearly lists all cookies and all tracking – their function, purpose and operator. </p>


<p>They enable the visitor to properly consent by giving them the full control of opting out of marketing cookies, if they don’t want their personal data to be used for targeted, behavioral advertisement or shared with unknown third-parties.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/advanced-cookie-notice-1024x532.png" alt="More advanced cookie notice from Cookiebot
" class="wp-image-1249"/><figcaption><em>More advanced cookie notice from Cookiebot</em></figcaption></figure>


<p>There’s more! Fully compliant cookie banners <strong>must have marketing cookies deactivated by default</strong>, i.e. marketing cookies have to be switched on manually by the visitor before activated by the website. </p>


<p>This is not the same as the visitor clicking “okay” on a banner, because the banner must have marketing cookies deactivated by default – so <em>if</em> the visitor quickly clicks “okay”, then what they are clicking “okay” to is, in fact, the deactivated marketing cookies.<br /></p>


<p>Why?&nbsp;</p>


<p>Well, remember from above that real consent is a <em>“clear and affirmative act”</em>. Affirmative is the keyword. </p>


<p>The visitor must <em>actively </em>consent marketing cookies, which means they have to <em>actively, affirmatively</em> spend those extra seconds turning the marketing cookies <em>on</em>.</p>


<p>Phew… with us so far?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cookibot-1024x563.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-1250"/></figure>


<h2>Consensual dynamic marketing?</h2>


<p>In this post-GDPR world of ours, there is only one scenario of compliant dynamic marketing.&nbsp;</p>


<p>It is this –&nbsp;</p>


<p>A visitor lands on a website and is presented with a cookie banner that informs them about all cookies and tracking on the website. </p>


<p>The visitor spends a couple of seconds glancing over the different cookies. </p>


<p>Or perhaps they don’t, maybe they suffer from <em>consent fatigue</em>, like so many other users, as a result of having been overexposed to non-compliant banners leaving them no true choice but to accept.&nbsp;</p>


<p>But let’s say, in this scenario, that the user, in fact, <em>does </em>choose to activate marketing cookies. </p>


<p>This means that they consent to have their personal data used for behavioral advertisement. </p>


<p>In that case, yes, a website owner and company is free to use this data to pursue dynamic marketing towards a visitor with all that that entails.<br /></p>


<h2><strong>Is WordPress GDPR Compliant?</strong></h2>


<p>And what about WordPress websites in all of that? Alkalab could not accept an article without talking about WordPress. </p>


<p>So they have added their part below. </p>


<p>WordPress core software is GDPR compliant, since WordPress version 4.9.6. </p>


<p>There has been an integration of several GDPR enhancements by the WordPress development team to make sure that WordPress is GDPR compliant. </p>


<p>Due to the dynamic nature of most websites, no single platform, extension or solution can provide 100% GDPR compliance. </p>


<p>The compliance process of GDPR will vary based on the type of website, the type of collected and stored, and the procedure of data processing on the website site.</p>


<p><strong><em>By default, WordPress now comes with the following GDPR enhancement features:</em></strong></p>


<h3><strong>1.&nbsp;Comments Consent</strong></h3>


<p>Formerly WordPress used to store information like <em>commenter&#8217;s</em> name, email and website as a cookie on the browser of the user by default and this made it very easy for users to comment on their favorite blogs because those fields were already pre-populated. </p>


<p>Due to the consent requirement of GDPR, WordPress has integrated the comment consent checkbox which enables the user to leave a comment without checking this box. </p>


<p>This means that they would have to enter their name, email, and website manually every time they leave a comment.</p>


<h3><strong>2. Data Export and Erase Feature</strong></h3>


<p>WordPress provides website owners with the ability to comply with the data handling requirements of GDPR and honor the request of users for exporting personal data and removal of the user’s personal data. </p>


<p>The data handling features of GDPR can be found under the <em>Tools</em> menu inside WordPress&#8217; admin dashboard.</p>


<h3><strong>3. Privacy Policy Generator</strong></h3>


<p>WordPress now comes with an inbuilt privacy policy generator features, to provide a pre-made privacy policy template.</p>


<p>This makes it easy for the website owner to be transparent with the users as regarding the type of data acquired, stored and how the data is used.</p>


<p><strong>Pro Tip: Use a cookie manager plugin on your website. Guess what? <a href="http://cookiebot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookiebot</a> has a WordPress plugin available for free on WordPress.org.</strong></p>


<figure class="wp-block-embed-wordpress aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-plugin-directory"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KruJJ1MSeQ"><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookiebot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookiebot | GDPR/CCPA Compliant Cookie Consent and Control</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cookiebot | GDPR/CCPA Compliant Cookie Consent and Control&#8221; &#8212; Plugin Directory" src="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookiebot/embed/#?secret=KruJJ1MSeQ" data-secret="KruJJ1MSeQ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div></figure>


<h2>Conclusion: How to Get GDPR Compliant Dynamic Marketing?</h2>


<p>In order to continue using dynamic marketing in compliance with the GDPR, your website needs to obtain prior consent from the user, i.e. that the user activates your website’s marketing cookies.&nbsp;</p>


<p>According to the GDPR, the control of a user’s personal data must be in the hands of the user themselves.&nbsp;</p>


<p>So if you want to continue exercising dynamic marketing on your website, your task is to persuade your visitors to opt-in for the marketing cookies. </p>


<p>You’ll have to tell them why it’s a good idea, what you can offer, how their experience of your site and your products will be enhanced by this opt-in.</p>


<p>In this post-GDPR world, the currency of transparency and privacy is worth more and more in the context of marketing.</p>


<p>As your customers become more informed and critical users, they will also expect and demand autonomy and security in how their data is handled online.</p>


<p>The balance to be struck for websites doing dynamic marketing now is to be totally GDPR compliant while offering safe and privacy-respecting advertisement options that can persuade users to activate those marketing cookies.</p>

<p>Here is the question, how do we find a good WordPress community theme? <br /></p>


<p>Communities are everywhere. <br /></p>


<p>Online, offline. Connected, not connected. <br /></p>


<p>But here is the thing. You want your community to be engaged. <br /></p>


<p>You don’t want it to shade off on the side. <br /></p>


<p>How to go about it? <br /></p>


<p>You can build Facebook Groups, Messenger or Slack communities. <br /></p>


<p>But you can also create a fully-fledged online application with more features than the usual posts/comments.<br /></p>


<p>And lucky you, WordPress makes it easy to build such an application. You can find WordPress community themes that will help you spin up your application in a matter of minutes.</p>


<h2>What is a WordPress Community Theme?</h2>


<p>First, let’s get down to the basics: a definition. <br /></p>


<p>What is a WordPress community theme?<br /></p>


<p>According to the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">codex</a>, here is the definition of a WordPress theme.<br /></p>


<p><em>“A WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a weblog. These files are called template files. A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software. Themes may include customized template files, image files (*.jpg, *.gif), style sheets (*.css), custom Pages, as well as any necessary code files (*.php). For an introduction to template files, see Stepping Into Templates.”</em><br /></p>


<p>There are very generic themes, that doesn’t focus on one specific thing. Great examples are <a href="https://1.envato.market/c/1292040/275988/4415?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthemeforest.net%2Fitem%2Favada-responsive-multipurpose-theme%2F2833226%3Fs_rank%3D1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Avada</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://1.envato.market/c/1292040/275988/4415?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthemeforest.net%2Fitem%2Fstack-multipurpose-wordpress-theme-with-variant-page-builder%2F19707359" target="_blank">Stack</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/avada.jpg" alt="Avada WordPress theme" class="wp-image-1192"/></figure>


<p>But there are also more specific themes that serve a specific niche or purpose. <br /></p>


<p>Community themes are such an example. They have different features, integrations, and a design that fits online communities. <br /></p>


<p>Most importantly, they work with the usual WordPress community plugins, the main one being <a href="https://buddypress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">BuddyPress</a>.<br /></p>


<p>Good. <br /></p>


<p>We know how to go about creating a quick and effective community. <br /></p>


<p>By fostering your community on a familiar platform such as WordPress you make it easy to start, but also easy to evolve and tailor. In fact, WordPress is <a href="https://wpnewsify.com/wordpress/state-wordpress-buddypress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">powering more than 30%</a> of the web. Think up… there are tons of proficient developers out there. <br /></p>


<p>The beauty? You keep and own your data. Everything is stored under your hood. <br /></p>


<p>Moving on the choice of our WordPress template. &nbsp;</p>


<h2>How To Choose The Right WordPress Theme for Your Community?</h2>


<p>Here are a few features you’ll be looking for in your WordPress theme when making the call for it.</p>


<h3>Design and Interface</h3>


<p>First thing first. How attractive and modern the theme is? <br /></p>


<p>Do you remember this old page from Facebook?<br /></p>


<p>Lucky me, I don’t. <br /></p>


<p>Either way, I’d be reluctant to use such a design.<br /></p>


<p>Okay, I’m going too far, exaggerating. But you get the point. <br /></p>


<p>The design is timely, it was likely good for the time. But not good for today. <br /></p>


<p>So we want anything but something similar to this. <br /></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/facebook.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1193"/><figcaption><em>Facebook in 2004﻿</em></figcaption></figure>


<p>We want an attractive design that gives us the willpower. Something we want to use. <br /></p>


<p>Something we feel easy to play with. We don’t have to mock around for 20 minutes before finding what we want.<br /></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/perfectionist-scale.jpg" alt="Where does the theme lands on this scale? (Interaction-Design.org)" class="wp-image-1194"/><figcaption><em>Where does the theme lands on this scale? (</em><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-design-perfectionist-s-checklist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Interaction-Design.org</em></a><em>)</em></figcaption></figure>


<p>Pro tip: make sure to check the design on your laptop, but also on tablets and smartphones. You absolutely want the theme to be responsive. <br /></p>


<p>Last, but not least, make sure that the theme loads fast. You don’t want the page to hang for 2 minutes before displaying what it’s supposed to. </p>


<h3>Social and Members-Related Features</h3>


<p>We have an easy-to-use application. <br /></p>


<p>But we still haven’t checked through our core features. <br /></p>


<p>We want to make a collaborative <a href="https://alkalab.com/blog/intranet-software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">intranet</a>/community site where our members can thrive.</p>


<p>We want to bring together, at the least, the following features: </p>


<ul><li>Social networking: whether we are talking about user profiles, activity posting, or any other social networking feature. It’s a must to have some of those basics </li><li>Messaging: being able to communicate with other members privately, or using group chat is required as well. We want the chat to be efficient, secure, supporting files and text formatting. </li><li>Forums: debating, contributing, asking public questions; these are all must-have features of our community theme.</li><li>Events management: sharing the next community event must be as easy as logging in! That’d be even better if our theme would support integrations with the major Calendar players (Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, Outlook). </li><li>File sharing: we would also want to be able to share files in private and public. This must be powerful enough to support different folders, so we can truly manage the files.</li></ul>


<p>Then, if we have e-commerce and even e-learning capabilities, that’d be the icing on the cake.<br /></p>


<p><a href="https://www.learndash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">LearnDash</a> is one of the most prominent Learning Management System for WordPress. <br /></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/learndash.jpg" alt="Learndash for WordPress community" class="wp-image-1195"/></figure>


<p>Before we dive into the comparison of the best themes out there. Let’s clear up any confusion and clarify the difference between a social network solution, and a fully-featured community theme. </p>


<h2>Social Network Themes for WordPress vs Community Theme vs Intranet Theme</h2>


<p>As they sound, social network themes are focused on the interaction online. Networking online. <br /></p>


<p>They usually use the famous BuddyPress plugin under the hood and add their layer on top of it to make the social interaction more attractive. &nbsp;<br /></p>


<p><em>BuddyPress is a free plugin that helps you build any kind of community website using WordPress, with member profiles, activity streams, user groups, messaging, and more.</em><br /></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/buddypress-1024x585.png" alt="BuddyPress WordPress Community Plugin" class="wp-image-1196"/></figure>


<p>Some of the common features include chat, groups, file sharing, commenting and posting. Think of it as a Facebook built using WordPress. <br /></p>


<p>On the other hand, community theme goes one step further and provide specific features meant at driving community engagement and interaction. Some examples include event management, member map, and member research tool, matchmaking, and much more. <br /></p>


<p>Lastly, the <a href="https://alkalab.com/wordpress-intranet-themes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intranet themes</a> are meant at providing a business-oriented solution for organizations and teams to collaborate effectively. They not only offer social features but also all the business-related requirements to run an efficient project and team &#8211; such as project management, knowledge base, HR, etc. <br /></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s create our BuddyPress Members Map using Vue.js.</p>


<p>Welcome to you. </p>


<p>This article will explain to you how to create a fully dynamic Google Maps of your BuddyPress Members on your WordPress site, on any page.  </p>


<p>Easily. </p>


<p>This tutorial is developed as we roll out this feature to our <a href="https://woffice.io?ref=alkaweb">Woffice theme, i</a>ntranet/extranet WordPress solution. </p>


<p>It already has a members map but it was: </p>


<ul class="is-style-checkbox"><li>1. Not dynamic. </li><li>2. Using old jQuery code.</li></ul>


<p>So time for a fresh look! </p>


<p>To follow this tutorial you need: </p>


<ul><li>A <a href="https://wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> setup with <a class="" href="https://buddypress.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><g class="gr_ gr_17 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="17" data-gr-id="17">BuddyPress</g></a> installed </li><li> PHP skills (OOP as well) but also WordPress development skills</li><li><a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vue.js</a> skills (at least the basics)</li><li>A Google cloud account to use the Maps JavaScript V3 API (<strong>to render the map</strong>) and Map Geolocation API (<strong>to convert locations into coordinates</strong>)</li></ul>


<p>We have split this tutorial into two parts: Backend &amp; Frontend. </p>


<p>Makes sense right? </p>


<p>Nothing new here. You will see it is pretty straightforward.</p>


<p>Before we start, this is developed within a theme, so designed for <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a child theme</a> if you do not have your own theme, but it can also be used a plugin with a couple of changes.  </p>


<p>Also, the final<em> (working!)</em> result can be found as a Zipped archive at the bottom of this page.<br /><br /><em>Last but not least, lots of functions will be prefixed </em><strong><em>woffice_</em></strong>, <em>change that with your own prefix</em>.<br /><br />Enough talking! Let&#8217;s get started.</p>


<h2>Part I: Create The Backend Side </h2>


<p>In this first part of our BuddyPress Member Map tutorial, we will create our PHP Class to handle everything in this tutorial in one single place. </p>


<p>Then, create the Location field to collect the member&#8217;s address. Store it safely. Once done, we will have an Ajax callback setup (which will be called by our Frontend Vue.Js component). </p>


<p>And we&#8217;ll optimize it to use as <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="6" data-gr-id="6">less</g> requests as possible (using some home-made cache).</p>


<h3>Getting The Member&#8217;s Location</h3>


<p>Firstly, let&#8217;s ask a quick question: How can we collect the user&#8217;s location, easily? </p>


<p>No idea. Com&#8217;on<g class="gr_ gr_15 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation multiReplace" id="15" data-gr-id="15">&#8230;.</g> Remember, we are teaming up with BuddyPress on this, so let&#8217;s use it! BuddyPress has a nice extension named: <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="8" data-gr-id="8"><g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="8" data-gr-id="8"><g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="8" data-gr-id="8">xProfile</g></g></g>. </p>


<p>You can activate it from the<strong> Settings &gt; BuddyPress &gt; Components screen</strong>. <br /></p>


<p>We are going to wrap all our PHP code in a class: <strong>Woffice_Members_Map</strong>, again change Woffice with your theme/plugin&#8217;s name. This class can be called from any PHP file, ideally functions.php (child or parent theme): </p>


<p><em>new Woffice_Members_Map();</em></p>


<p>We will simply create a method that will be attached to the <em>`xprofile_updated_profile`&nbsp;</em>BuddyPress action, so our code will be executed whenever someone saves its profile. </p>


<p>We avoid using bp_init. </p>


<p>Because otherwise it&#8217;s being run on every page load. <strong>However, it means you need to save your profile to generate the field.</strong> Feel free to use any other specific action, like on theme activation. </p>


<p>Once hooked, we run a SQL query to see if the Location field exists and otherwise we create it. </p>


<p>Plain and simple. </p>


<div class="wp-block-coblocks-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/5e75d6bb81f80277eb6cb4af1018d10c.js"></script><noscript><a href="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/5e75d6bb81f80277eb6cb4af1018d10c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View this gist on GitHub</a></noscript></div>


<p>That will (<em>should</em>) give you a new field when you edit your BuddyPress profile. &#8220;Location&#8221;, it will hold the member&#8217;s location inside our database.  </p>


<h3>Saving The Coordinates in Our Database</h3>


<p>We now have nice locations getting saved, but Google Map does not eat this kind of food. The diet is Geographic coordinates. </p>


<p>Therefore, how do we get coordinates from human-wrote locations? <br /><br />Well, we use the Google API: <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Google Maps Geocoding API (opens in a new tab)" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro" target="_blank">Google Maps Geocoding API</a></strong>. </p>


<p>This API turns addresses into coordinates. </p>


<p>So you need to create a new Google Cloud Account (if you do not have one yet), create a new project called &#8220;Members Map&#8221; and activate this API. You can also enable the JavaScript map API as well. We will need it later on. Once both APIs created, generate API keys from the <strong>Credentials</strong> screen. </p>


<p>We need those. <br /></p>


<p>Here is our Woffice theme&#8217;s doc article about how to get them: <br /><a href="https://alkaweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WOF/pages/4227317/Google+Map+Geocoding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Map Geocoding</a></p>


<p>Then, we will save all coordinates inside our database, within the <em>wp_options</em> table. As a new option. </p>


<p>Why?  </p>


<p>Because requests are expensive to this API. </p>


<p>Thus, the idea is to call it only when needed, so if we already have the coordinates for one member, we don&#8217;t need it again, unless, of course, it&#8217;s being updated. </p>


<p>The option name in this example will be: &#8220;<em>woffice_map_locations</em>&#8220;. The data inside is formatted using JSON. </p>


<p>Let&#8217;s do it! Three new methods in our PHP Class: </p>


<ul><li><strong>saveSingleMember()</strong> which is hooked to the `<em>xprofile_updated_profile</em>` action, so whenever a new member profile is saved, we will see if there is an existing entry in our option and if not, fetch the coordinates. Same if it&#8217;s being updated.  </li><li><strong>getMemberCoordinates()</strong> which will fetch the Coordinates for a given member. That&#8217;s where we will call the API and the BuddyPress <g class="gr_ gr_529 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="529" data-gr-id="529">xProfile</g> field. </li><li><strong>apiRequest()&nbsp;</strong>is a helper to call the API and returns the result.  </li></ul>


<div class="wp-block-coblocks-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/c12144c7e330246fa25ad1a27c267a71.js"></script><noscript><a href="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/c12144c7e330246fa25ad1a27c267a71" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View this gist on GitHub</a></noscript></div>


<p><em>Notes</em>:<br /></p>


<ul><li>We split into 3 methods because if you want to use a more complex workflow, some methods can be reused independently. Like having a button that regenerates all coordinates, we do that in Woffice and you don&#8217;t need the first method but the other two. </li><li>We are using a Class attribute ($privateApiKey) to hold the API key, if you have a Theme Settings page, get it from there.</li></ul>


<p>Cool! </p>


<p>So now, we can save addresses in our profile and get coordinates saved inside our database. </p>


<p>That really is all we need ? Here is an example of the result in the Database: </p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MySQL_5_7_23__localhost_eonet_dev_wp_options.jpg" alt="Database preview" class="wp-image-1138"/></figure></div>


<h3>Creating The Ajax callback</h3>


<p><g class="gr_ gr_49 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="49" data-gr-id="49">Third</g> step, the goal of this part is to make the coordinates we just saved inside our <em>wp_options</em> table available from the Frontend side, safely. Of course. <br /><br />In the <strong>__construct()</strong> method, let&#8217;s add our Ajax callback functions: <br /></p>


<div class="wp-block-coblocks-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/fa12bb2e0991416428eacc82ccbdb0a9.js"></script><noscript><a href="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/fa12bb2e0991416428eacc82ccbdb0a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View this gist on GitHub</a></noscript></div>


<p>If you are not comfortable with how WordPress handles Ajax requests, please have a look at <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a>. <br /></p>


<p>Also, we are using a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Nonces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress nonce</a> to make the request safer and make it can only be sent through our Vue.js component.<br /><br />Here is the <strong>loadMembers()</strong> method that we can add in our class: </p>


<div class="wp-block-coblocks-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/09283d0373b4e9e5b193f57c291fd826.js"></script><noscript><a href="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/09283d0373b4e9e5b193f57c291fd826" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View this gist on GitHub</a></noscript></div>


<p>As you can see, we are also adding a `<em>woffice_members_map_locations</em>` filter to let any child theme or plugin add custom data to the response using a WordPress filter. </p>


<p>There is also a default response if there <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">is</g> no coordinates found. </p>


<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>


<p>Part I is over! As of right now, the backend part is done. No more PHP, well, almost. Here is a quick recap of what we&#8217;ve done: <br /></p>


<ol><li>Insert automatically a new BuddyPress xProfile field in the user&#8217;s profile page to collect the Location. </li><li>Use the Geocoding API to turn this Location into GPS coordinates and saved them inside our database in the wp_options table as a new option to save requests.</li><li>Created an Ajax callback to return the saved coordinates as a formatted array.</li></ol>


<p>Real cakewalk ?</p>


<h2>Part II: Create The Frontend Side </h2>


<p>What we will do in this part will be to create the Vue.js component, define it, register it and call it with a PHP function. <br /><br />The goal of the component is to wrap everything in a single Vue.js component (that&#8217;s the real magic!), no dependency, just this component. Once the component loaded, it will do three pretty cool, yet simple things:  <br /></p>


<ol><li>Create the Google Map</li><li>Fetch the Members coordinates </li><li>Render the Members into the map</li></ol>


<h3>Define Our Vue.js Component </h3>


<p>First off, create a new file called <em>js/wofficeMembersMap.js</em>, it will hold our Vue.js component. </p>


<p>We will &#8220;<a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enqueue</a>&#8221; it to the page&#8217;s footer within our <strong>__contstruct()</strong> method: </p>


<div class="wp-block-coblocks-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/23e528a34dc1343c10269e59de2b3739.js"></script><noscript><a href="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/23e528a34dc1343c10269e59de2b3739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View this gist on GitHub</a></noscript></div>


<p>And therefore, also add a new method to register both the library and our component: </p>


<div class="wp-block-coblocks-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/7a0f06139205dc7eca723d1dd1e3caf3.js"></script><noscript><a href="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/7a0f06139205dc7eca723d1dd1e3caf3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View this gist on GitHub</a></noscript></div>


<p>As you can see, we are also embedding the Google JavaScript Map API. Therefore you need to create another (different one than the one used before the backend side: geocoding process) <strong>public key</strong>. </p>


<p>Once done, register it in the class as a new attribute.</p>


<div class="wp-block-coblocks-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/7b0ffa480aded7640316060b208f0795.js"></script><noscript><a href="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/7b0ffa480aded7640316060b208f0795" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View this gist on GitHub</a></noscript></div>


<p>Once that&#8217;s set up, you will see both JavaScript assets loaded in your source code. Now, we can create the scaffolding of our component with our newly registered &#8220;.js&#8221; file:  </p>


<div class="wp-block-coblocks-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/f1cc326d34ae1abc97583f6650e42f66.js"></script><noscript><a href="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/f1cc326d34ae1abc97583f6650e42f66" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View this gist on GitHub</a></noscript></div>


<p>What are we doing here? </p>


<ul><li>Creating a new Vue.js instance, that&#8217;s not a required <g class="gr_ gr_18 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="18" data-gr-id="18">step,</g> if you&#8217;re using Vue.js already. Then just register the new component to this instance instead. Vue power! </li><li>Set up the markup, very easy here as it&#8217;s going to be rendered by Google Map, not us. </li><li>Registering our two component properties: height, <g class="gr_ gr_13 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="13" data-gr-id="13">url</g>.</li><li>Setting up the default Vue.js hooks that we are going to use. We could use some other ones as well, for the sake of simplicity, those 2 will do just fine! Make sure to <g class="gr_ gr_14 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="14" data-gr-id="14">checkout</g> this<strong> must-read</strong> doc article from Vue.js:  <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html#Lifecycle-Diagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lifecycle diagram</a>.  </li><li>Note that we are using old JavaScript markup here because we (Woffice developers) want to keep support for old browsers and care a lot about the final bundle size. But this code is easily adaptable to ES6 using Babel. Nothing tricky.   </li></ul>


<h3>Render The Component Using PHP</h3>


<p>There are several ways to display the Vue.js component, we can use a PHP function like <em>woffice_render_members_map()</em> and call it from a template. </p>


<p>But we can also use a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shortcode</a>. Which offers the same advantages of the first method but on top of this, you can also use it right from the editor. <br /><br />So, let&#8217;s create a new shortcode: <strong>[woffice_members_map]</strong> that you can use from your editor or using the <strong><a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_shortcode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do_shortcode()</a></strong> function from your template. The other advantage is that you can pass attributes later on if you want to extend it easily. <br /><br />Nothing new here, we need to register it from our <strong>__contstruct()</strong> method.</p>


<div class="wp-block-coblocks-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/de6d6040866f82b029effa61a3bd5e75.js"></script><noscript><a href="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/de6d6040866f82b029effa61a3bd5e75" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View this gist on GitHub</a></noscript></div>


<p>And then, the method itself that will simply output the Vue.js component with some HTML markup. </p>


<p>We also pass attributes directly there to avoid using a &#8220;Data exchanger&#8221; (registering a JavaScript object in the <em>wp_footer</em> hook on the PHP level to pass data between PHP and JavaScript). </p>


<div class="wp-block-coblocks-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/bc13086d22b89f592f6c79e52e9cd05a.js"></script><noscript><a href="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/bc13086d22b89f592f6c79e52e9cd05a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View this gist on GitHub</a></noscript></div>


<h3>Create The Google Map</h3>


<p>At the same time, we are simply going to create a new method in our component: <strong>createMap()</strong>. </p>


<p>Which will? &#8230; &#8230; Create the map! </p>


<p>Not original, but makes sense. </p>


<p>That method will set the map&#8217;s height and use the Google Map API to generate a simple map:</p>


<div class="wp-block-coblocks-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/b8e9ea6070e936d3cd8a9a02dc10dec9.js"></script><noscript><a href="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/b8e9ea6070e936d3cd8a9a02dc10dec9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View this gist on GitHub</a></noscript></div>


<p>Did you notice? We are using the famous component&#8217;s data object to store the map&#8217;s zoom level and center. Feel free to improve it and use shortcode/coordinates attributes. Moreover, you can use <a href="https://www.latlong.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this website</a> to get the Latitude and Coordinates of any address. </p>


<p>This is a VERY simple example, you can make it a LOT more complex (custom style, custom controls, animations&#8230;). </p>


<p>Google showcases an <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent documentation</a> on this API. So when you use <strong>[woffice_members_map] </strong>in any post or page, you should (will, I hope) see:</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Shortcode_tuto_–_Eonet_Dev-1024x511.jpg" alt="Tutorial Preview" class="wp-image-1139"/></figure>


<h3>Fetch Our Members</h3>


<p>Okay, so we have a map. </p>


<p>How about we now call the Ajax callback we have defined in the first step to fetch our Members coordinates from our database and render them? Sounds good. <br /><br />Update the <strong>mounted()</strong> hooks to call a new method that we will define under the <strong>methods: {}</strong> object: </p>


<div class="wp-block-coblocks-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/8b0e952557593722bc767836cc2d7b17.js"></script><noscript><a href="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/8b0e952557593722bc767836cc2d7b17" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View this gist on GitHub</a></noscript></div>


<div class="wp-block-coblocks-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/0f8e147124709fa6435e16365a62255b.js"></script><noscript><a href="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/0f8e147124709fa6435e16365a62255b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View this gist on GitHub</a></noscript></div>


<p>Couple of things to notice here: </p>


<p>Firstly, we are using a &#8220;WordPress nonce&#8221; to secure the request.  </p>


<p>Secondly, we store the fetched members coordinates in the <em>data</em> object to be able to use it easily in any other method of our component. </p>


<p>Once done, we call a new method: <strong>drawMarkers()</strong>. </p>


<p>See the next section ?</p>


<p>Last but not least, install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vue.js dev tool</a>. You will be able to visualize the data: </p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Shortcode_tuto_–_Eonet_Dev-1-1024x532.jpg" alt="First Preview of our Map in Woffice" class="wp-image-1141"/></figure></div>


<h3>Add The Markers To The Map</h3>


<p>Finally, here we are, the last step! </p>


<p>We now have a map and members coordinates, how about we do some cooking to mix them? </p>


<p>Sounds good to me. </p>


<p>Nothing fancy, let&#8217;s define the <strong>drawMarkers()</strong> method called in the last method in the fetch members&#8217; success callback function. This method will go through all member locations we received from our backend and create a Google Map marker (<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/markers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more details here</a>). </p>


<p>Then, we will use the user&#8217;s info, that we pass as well in the Ajax PHP callback to have some HTML markup inside the map marker. Again, easy-peasy.</p>


<div class="wp-block-coblocks-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/5d4dc5e2a8ddb448c87e0a429aab7654.js"></script><noscript><a href="https://gist.github.com/2Fwebd/5d4dc5e2a8ddb448c87e0a429aab7654" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View this gist on GitHub</a></noscript></div>


<p>As you very likely have guessed, we are using a child theme in this tutorial for our <a href="https://woffice.io?ref=alkaweb">Woffice theme</a>. </p>


<p>Which provides Bootstrap 4 out of the box, so no CSS, yay! I just used helper classes to get a &#8220;nice&#8221; (not bad) layout inside my marker: </p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Shortcode_tuto_–_Eonet_Dev-2-1024x494.jpg" alt="Preview of WordPress BuddyPress Members Map" class="wp-image-1143"/></figure></div>


<p>Which is our final result! <em>Just this?</em> <strong>Wait</strong>, that&#8217;s a simple example, it&#8217;s super flexible, will support as many members you want, you can change the content, style, animations, marker and a lot more. </p>


<p>You can see some cool examples in our <a href="https://demos.alka-web.com/eonet/members-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eonet</a> and <a href="https://demos.alka-web.com/woffice/business/members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Woffice</a> members demo pages.</p>


<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>


<p>In summary, what we have done in this frontend part is: </p>


<ol><li>Add Vue.js and the Google map public librairies to our frontend side. Plus, registering our own Vue.js component. </li><li>Create a Google Map using the Google Map API v3. </li><li>Fetch our members using the Ajax callback we have defined in the first step. </li><li>Render the members in the map using some pretty cool map markers. </li></ol>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>


<p>Hope you liked it! You are now able to create your own BuddyPress Members Map. </p>


<p>For any detail or improvement you have in mind, please use the comment section below. <br /><br />This being said, a couple of final notes here: </p>


<ul><li><strong>Vue.js can be added to WordPress</strong>, <em>VERY</em> easily. It&#8217;s dynamic and easy to develop with. Use ES6 if you can.</li><li>If you have many members and they &#8220;step&#8221; on each other, <strong>consider using Marker clusters</strong> (<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/marker-clustering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see this article</a>).</li><li>Finally, This tutorial was designed to be as simple as possible, <strong>there are dozens of improvements you can apply</strong>: using theme options, custom attributes, better marker markup, custom map style, better error handling and so on. </li></ul>

<p>If you are like me, you have, at least once, been looking for the perfect collaboration tool for your business. <br /></p>


<p>Did not feel like you could find the right software? <br /></p>


<p>Nor did I. <br /></p>


<p>Which is why I went ahead and made some serious researches to run down the best resources and tools available out there for business to collaborate. <br /></p>


<p>They are all yours today. <br /></p>


<p>Enjoy these collaboration tools, and leave us your feedback. <br /></p>


<h2>Free Online Collaboration Tools for Business</h2>


<p>As a starter, we will cover the free tools. We are talking about <a href="https://www.chargebee.com/blog/freemium-business-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">freemium solutions</a> &#8211; meaning you can start using the tool for free, and then upgrade as you grow the usage &#8211; and entirely free solutions here. </p>


<h3>Team Collaboration Tools</h3>


<p><strong><a href="https://slack.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slack</a> </strong>is one of the most prominent team collaboration and chat tool out there. Slack is organized in channels and conversations, where you can talk with a set of colleagues/people on specific topics, share files, comment on files, and much more. <br /></p>


<p>As Slack puts it, it is <strong>“your hub for teamwork”</strong></p>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><em>Project discussions, important documents, free food announcements: they all live tidily together in Slack. With your team and information in one easily searchable place, collaborating online is as easy as collaborating in person.</em></p></blockquote>


<p>The pro version of Slack also offers a meeting solution in order to organize group calls and video conferences with your colleagues.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/slack.png" alt="Slack Preview" class="wp-image-1163"/></figure></div>


<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.chanty.com/" target="_blank">Chanty</a> is a great alternative to Slack. It is a freemium AI-powered team chat with unlimited messages for free. Great solution to boost internal communication for startups, small and medium-sized teams.<br /></p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chanty-1024x503.png" alt="Chanty Preview" class="wp-image-1164"/></figure></div>


<h3>Meeting </h3>


<p>Let’s cover the meeting solutions, in order to host and organize meetings with colleagues, partners, and clients.<br /></p>


<p><strong><a href="https://appear.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Appear.in</a></strong> is a great web-based meeting solution. </p>


<p>You can sign up and register your locked room, then share the link with your team and clients.<br /></p>


<p>It’s the easiest meeting solution I have found so far. You can chat, share your screen with a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/appearin-screen-sharing/bodncoafpihbhpfljcaofnebjkaiaiga?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Chrome Extension</a>, invite up to 4 participants for free. And they even have a mobile application.<br /></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://livestorm.co/meet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Livestorm</a></strong> is another great alternative. The main software is a webinar solution but they recently spun off a meeting solution. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>


<p>It offers meeting, private rooms, chat and integrations with the webinar solutions. This is a great solution to both uses with your colleagues and (potential) clients.<br /></p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/livestorm-1024x632.png" alt="Livestorm Meet" class="wp-image-1166"/></figure></div>


<h3>Design &amp; Document Collaboration Tools</h3>


<p><a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Figma</a> is our first tool on the list of collaboration software. It lets you design, prototype, and collaborate all in the browser. <br /></p>


<p>It is a great alternative to the infinite back-and-forth designer &lt;&gt; project manager loop. You can think of it as a simplified wireframe/design app in your browser with collaboration features, for free.<br /></p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/figma-1024x475.png" alt="Figma" class="wp-image-1167"/></figure></div>

It is a tool to connect and gather all of your resources into one place, easily find and organize them. It syncs up with GSuite, Slack, Dropbox, and many more professional apps.<br /></p>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><em>FYI brings all of your documents together in one place, no matter what apps or accounts they are in</em>.<br /></p></blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fyi-1024x636.png" alt="FYI preview" class="wp-image-1168"/></figure></div>


<h3>Time Management Software</h3>


<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.timedoctor.com/" target="_blank">Time Doctor</a> is an accurate time tracking software that provides detailed analytics of where time is spent on the workday. </p>


<p>It helps you stay focused by gently nudging you when you get distracted from work. Time Doctor also provides time tracking, computer work session monitoring, reminders, screenshot recording, invoicing, reporting tools, integrations and so much more.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Reports-2.png" alt="TimeDoctor" class="wp-image-1200"/></figure></div>


<p>If you are looking for a free alternative, you can look at <a href="https://toggl.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Toggl.com. (opens in a new tab)">Toggl.com.</a></p>


<h2>Project Management Softwares</h2>


<p>Let’s move on the project management solutions. <br /></p>


<p><strong><a href="https://trello.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Trello</a></strong>. First up, I want to cover what has become one of the landmarks in terms of project management and kanban solution. It is one of the easiest and flexible solutions I have found to manage anything. <br /></p>


<p>You can literally create a board for anything you want, from a website re-design to managing your client and organizing your todo list. <br /></p>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>The team liked it. With a strong product and name in hand, the team launched at TechCrunch Disrupt in September 2011 and the app took off from there. By July 2014, Trello spun off from Fog Creek, and the app had over 4.75 million users.</em></p><p><em>Within the next three years, Trello grew exponentially. In 2017, the company was acquired by Atlassian (famous for creating Jira and Bitbucket) and hit 25 million signups. In other words, Trello increased its user base by 426% in 3 years.</em></p><cite><a href="https://www.drift.com/blog/trello/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Drift Team (opens in a new tab)">Drift Team</a></cite></blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/trello-1024x399.png" alt="Trello" class="wp-image-1169"/></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://clickup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">ClickUp</a> is another up-and-coming contender in the Project Management space. <br /></p>


<p>It offers different views: calendar, kanband, list and even GANTT, with plenty of integrations and ways to manage the tasks. The UX is polished and amazing.<br /></p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/clickup-1024x509.png" alt="Clickup" class="wp-image-1170"/></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://todoist.com/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Todoist</a> is our last item on the list. As the name implies, the product is focused on organizing your todo-lists. It offers categories, filters, collaboration and calendar integrations. <br /></p>


<p>A must-have for organizing your backlog of things to do. <br /></p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/todoist-1024x521.png" alt="Todoist" class="wp-image-1171"/></figure></div>


<h2>Intranet &amp; All-In-One Premium Collaboration Solutions</h2>


<p>The last category of tools we are going to cover is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://alkalab.com/blog/benefits-intranet/" target="_blank"><g class="gr_ gr_13 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="13" data-gr-id="13">intranet</g></a><g class="gr_ gr_13 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="13" data-gr-id="13">,</g> or team portal. They help you stay organized and gather the information into one place. <br /></p>


<p>Those are not free, but they are worth it.</p>


<p>Whether you want to keep track of the information with your clients or colleagues, it’s worth having a look.<br /></p>


<p>Let me walk you through two promising solutions.<br /></p>


<p><a href="https://woffice.io?ref=alkaweb">Woffice.io</a> is the first item on our list. It is an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Intranet/Extranet (opens in a new tab)" href="https://alkalab.com/blog/intranet-software/" target="_blank">Intranet/Extranet</a> WordPress-based solution. It comes with knowledge base management, member map, and member management, project management, HR features, and many more. <br /></p>


<p>The tool can even go as far as being your online hub for corporate courses and tutorials. <br /></p>


<p>Although you might be afraid of using it since it’s based on <a href="https://alkalab.com/blog/tutorial-wordpress-plugin-web-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="WordPress (opens in a new tab)">WordPress</a>, I’d tell you two things: </p>


<ul><li>You only pay once: for the license fee, and you’re good to go</li><li>You manage the data, and you own the code. Which means that you can completely customize and extend the scope of it. </li></ul>


<p>The installation is a no-brainer, and the administrators will be the only ones to know that the intranet is powered by WordPress under the hood. <br /></p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/woffice-785x1024.jpg" alt="Woffice" class="wp-image-1172"/></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Confluence</a> is the open and online shared workspace solution from Atlassian.</p>


<p>It enables organizations to collaborate on project planning, meeting notes, documentation, blog posts, and plenty of additional written documents. <br /></p>


<p>Great solution to gather the bits from different places.<br /></p>

<p>Like for many things today, you have a lot of choices when it comes to choosing an intranet software that suits your needs. But how to find the best intranet software? <br /></p>


<p>I have already covered the <a href="https://alkalab.com/blog/benefits-intranet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">benefits of using an intranet.</a></p>


<p>Today, I will give you an overview of the different possibilities when it comes to picking an intranet solution. <br /></p>


<p>This means that we will not only cover the different providers, but we will also cover the different types of intranet and extranet. &nbsp;<br /></p>


<p>Without further ado, let’s get into the core of the matter. </p>


<h2>What Are Intranet And Extranet?</h2>


<p>An intranet is a private space meant at improving the collaboration within your company. </p>


<p>It usually features a chat system, a knowledge base, a blog section, an employee portal, and some more advanced HR features. <br /></p>


<p>An intranet plays different roles and faces different challenges depending on the size of the company, the type of company and the culture. <br /></p>


<p>To make things simpler, we then split out the intranet into different categories based on their goals and missions.<br /></p>


<p>Intranets become more and more important as companies become more connected and become more remote-friendly. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image.png" alt="State of Remote Work by Buffer" class="wp-image-1091"/><figcaption>State of Remote Work by Buffer</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As mentioned by Buffer in the <a href="https://open.buffer.com/state-remote-work-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">State of Remote Work</a>, there is an upward trend when it comes to letting employees work remotely. <br /></p>


<p>This means that employees need to find new and innovative ways to build <a href="https://visibly.io/what-is-employee-advocacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">employee advocacy</a> and involve them at every stage of the company. <br /></p>


<p>This is where the social intranet software comes in. <br /></p>


<h3>What Is a Social Intranet Software? </h3>


<p>As simple as it sounds, a social <g class="gr_ gr_16 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar" id="16" data-gr-id="16">intranet</g> improves the social engagement among the organization. <br /></p>


<p>Think of it as a social network inside the application. It motivates employees to be more productive. <br /></p>


<p>A social intranet is simply an internal-facing web application where employees can easily contribute knowledge and communicate with each other to make work more efficient and effective.<br /></p>


<p>One of the most important features of such intranet is the chatting system. We want employees to help each other. </p>


<p>But more than that, we want them to get to know each other. <br /></p>


<p>Some companies even go as far as organizing virtual meetups every week, month or so. <br /></p>


<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="181: How to Manage Remote Teams" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qJUpPBhZHAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>


<p>In order to properly understand the whys of such social intranet, let’s go back to the basics of what does “social” mean. <br /></p>


<p>The terms social refers to the interactions between humans. Social networking is the act of actually building relationships. <br /></p>


<p>We have come a long way since the beginning of social networking. It all started with people networking at the coffee machine. Then, the early days of social media software, and now more advanced social intranet software. <br /></p>


<p>Engaging employees and nudging them to do more than “working” for the company has positives results on the turnover. </p>


<p>But it also springs up the reputation of the company and the attractiveness of the company. <br /></p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3SCHZtofMdD3yFV29aXSoCif2BlMGCQ0iodGO41EZvKVyz2QRUahNlsKdmXoJ6EWQ7oVihziye1uA3hIdjBik_c2nkdoo8QjKCxZVOwbVMP3-DP-7WRBT5KfkUp5e2ngOaoErbL5" alt="Statistics about employee engagement by Gartner﻿"/><figcaption><a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/marc-brown/fuel-your-everyone-sells-culture-through-employee-advocacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Statistics about employee engagement by Gartner﻿</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Which is what amount for such intranet: </p>


<ul><li><strong>Engagement, connection, and interactions</strong>: all employees get to know each other and talk with each other</li><li><strong>Ownership and authorship: </strong>everyone can and is urged to participate in the conversation and contribute in its own way</li></ul>


<p>All of that helps the employees build relationships.<br /></p>


<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/workplace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Workplace by Facebook</a> is a great example. <br /></p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cDm9wj5RCUcb-2QnxbJydMK4ng0uFia72-6VxxRLcQJeHT1wW2bZqSC_1Rv6ltNcVhisLnSSUUZFk8NOMq3dC7aRF39VhszTwlaRQuYMvgtSCqazF6VIqeKwulO2ENGnqOSx_yCM" alt="Workplace By Facebook Intranet Software Example"/></figure></div>


<p>More advanced social intranet software will also include <a href="https://feedier.com/blog/reasons-gamification-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">gamification</a> features in order to further empower employees and push them to engage.<br /></p>


<p>It could be the likes of giving points for the number of contributions or challenging employees based on their activity. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://axerosolutions.com/" target="_blank">Axero is a great example.</a></p>


<p><a href="https://gamipress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="GamiPress (opens in a new tab)">GamiPress</a> is also a great open-source solution.</p>


<h3>What Is an Employee Intranet Portal?</h3>


<p>We have seen that social intranets are focused on building relationships among your employees and push them to engage. They make intranet and collaboration more fun.<br /></p>


<p>On the other hand, employee intranets are more standard forms of <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="4" data-gr-id="4">intranets</g>. </p>


<p>They mainly focus on providing HR functionalities, such as leave requests, expenses accounts, etc. <br /></p>


<p>According to a study by <a href="http://www.prescientdigital.com/downloads/2012%20Social%20Intranet%20Study_Summary_Prescient%20Digital%20Media.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Prescient Digital</a>, while 80% of organizations have had intranets for a while, they were not used at their full potential. Most employees visit their intranet only about once a month and 75 percent use them solely for HR purposes. <br /></p>


<p>The culprit? <br /></p>


<p>The lack of social interaction and the poor User Experience. </p>


<p><strong>Communication and networking must be made easy. </strong><br /></p>


<p>Which is why your intranet should have features from both world. <br /></p>


<p>All-in-all, your intranet should strip out all the useless features and focus on what’s important for your company. <br /></p>


<h4>Intranet Features</h4>


<p>Some useful intranet features include: <br /></p>


<ul><li>Social media features such as comment, like, Q&amp;A, FAQ, tag</li><li>Content sharing (video, images, resources) and knowledge base</li><li>Powerful search engine</li><li>Content collaboration, transparency, and history of collaboration</li><li>Role management, as well as access management</li></ul>


<p>Do you need more employee engagement? Are your leave requests managed effectively? <br /></p>


<p>Add them to the list of features. <br /></p>


<p>Eventually, focus on this north star: making your employees’ lives easier and better together. <br /></p>


<h3>What Is an Extranet?</h3>


<p>An extranet is similar but focused on making the communication with the<em> outside </em>smoother. It could range from the communication with the clients to partners and other stakeholders.<br /></p>


<p>We have the covered the basics of intranet portals. <br /></p>


<p><em>But how do go about booting up your intranet? What is the best way to get it up and running?</em></p>


<p>Although some companies using an intranet still rely on a custom on-premise intranet, most companies are turning to the cloud today. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>


<p>I’ll walk you through the different cloud-based intranet solutions. </p>


<h2>Different Cloud-Based Intranet Solutions</h2>


<p>A study was conducted by <a href="http://www.prescientdigital.com/articles/social-intranet-survey-2011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Prescient Digital</a> a few years ago about the different solutions used by companies to power their intranet.<br /></p>


<p>The results are very interesting and suggest that there is no rule-of-thumb when it comes to setting up an intranet. &nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NkdyKoCfeEqxjdNGcZ9mppUk6jLH9vCnzPi6haYxxGJL6fmguk4-UpJkQ3D11xBf0tLnJy7YGMut1DRUoPFLF9Bzmvjk-2X_T7kTbuQKYC5LJheVrWuHJUVBK-e9ikdom5J-pdoR" alt="What Types of Technology Powers Your Intranet"/><figcaption>What Types of Technology Powers Your Intranet</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Which makes my study even more interesting. </p>


<h3>SaaS Intranets</h3>


<p>To start off, let’s talk about the Software as a Service (SaaS) intranet. The SaaS market is rapidly growing and expanding into all types of verticals. <br /></p>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><em>“The global SaaS market has been predicted to expand at a CAGR of 19.9% between 2015 and 2022 and is forecasted to reach $71.2 billion in 2018 &#8211; a 21.5% increase from 2017.”</em><br /></p><cite><em> </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://crozdesk.com/software-research/saas-and-cloud-market-predictions-2018" target="_blank">Crozdesk</a></cite></blockquote>


<p>The intranet is one vertical. </p>


<h4>SaaS Intranet Upsides</h4>


<p><strong>Cost and ease-of-use</strong></p>


<p>The main benefits of using SaaS rely on the cost and ease of use. You usually don’t need any technical skill to get the intranet up-and-running, which makes the barrier to entry very low. <br /></p>


<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>


<p>They are also hosted by the provider, which means that you don’t have to worry about performances and down-times (provided you choose a good solution ?).<br /></p>


<blockquote class="wp-block-coblocks-click-to-tweet"><p class="wp-block-coblocks-click-to-tweet__text"><em>Setting up an on-premise intranet used to take between 6 to 9 months. Your intranet can be ready in </em><strong><em>30 minutes using a SaaS software</em></strong><em>. </em><br /></p><a class="wp-block-coblocks-click-to-tweet__twitter-btn" href="http://twitter.com/share?&amp;text=%3Cem%3ESetting%20up%20an%20on-premise%20intranet%20used%20to%20take%20between%206%20to%209%20months.%20Your%20intranet%20can%20be%20ready%20in%20%3C%2Fem%3E%3Cstrong%3E%3Cem%3E30%20minutes%20using%20a%20SaaS%20software%3C%2Fem%3E%3C%2Fstrong%3E%3Cem%3E.%20%3C%2Fem%3E%3Cbr%3E&amp;url=https://alkalab.com/blog/intranet-software/&amp;via=alkaweb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tweet</a></blockquote>


<p><strong>No engagement </strong></p>


<p>Finally, the engagement is another aspect. How long will you use this for? You don’t know. <br /></p>


<p>Most SaaS providers offer monthly and yearly plans, which means that you can back out at any time if you decide to change. <br /></p>


<h4>SaaS Intranet Downsides</h4>


<p>Although you don’t need to worry about performances and hosting, it also comes with its own set of downsides. First, if there is a bump in the usage of the software, you’re likely to feel the pinch and get lower performances. <br /></p>


<p>Then, there is also the lack of flexibility. SaaS providers offer you a ready-made software, more or less customisable. <br /></p>


<p>Which means that if you have very specific requirements or edge-cases, you will either have to splash out, or find a very flexible solution. <br /></p>


<p>The latter is usually less user-friendly and harder to get started with.<br /></p>


<h4>SaaS Intranet Providers</h4>


<p>I’m now going to cover the best intranet SaaS according to reviews on the Web and usage.<br /></p>


<p>The first one on the list is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/workplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workplace By Facebook.</a> It is rated <a href="https://www.g2crowd.com/products/workplace-by-facebook/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.9/5 on G2Crowd&nbsp;with&nbsp;~800&nbsp;r</a>eviews.</p>

<h3>Content Management System (CMS) And WordPress Intranets </h3>


<p>As mentioned earlier, setting up your own intranet used to be very costly, long and difficult. <br /></p>


<p>But the Content Management Systems and <a href="https://wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="WordPress (opens in a new tab)">WordPress</a> came into play.<br /></p>


<p>And they make things easier. <br /></p>


<p>The principle behind that is fairly simple. WordPress provides a framework for you to get started with, as well as some templates. <br /></p>


<p>You can then customize them and tailor them to your needs. <br /></p>


<h4>WordPress Intranet Upsides</h4>


<p>First of all, WordPress intranets are usually way cheaper than SaaS providers. All you need is a server to run WordPress and host your intranet software. <br /></p>


<p>Besides this, you can find a lot of <a href="https://alkalab.com/blog/wordpress-intranet-themes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great</a><a href="https://alkalab.com/wordpress-intranet-themes/]" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> boilerplates and WordPress Intranet themes to get started with.</a> So you will only need to install and customize!</p>


<p>WordPress codebase will also be in your hand, and so does the WordPress theme files, which means that you can fully customize and extend the scope of your intranet.  </p>


<p>WordPress’s directory of 50K+ plugins will also help for extending the scope of your intranet. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://alkalab.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-1-1024x678.png" alt="WordPress Intranet Upsides" class="wp-image-1095"/><figcaption>WordPress Intranet Upsides</figcaption></figure></div>


<h4>WordPress Intranet Downsides</h4>


<p>It also comes with its set of inconvenient or barriers to entry. The first one being the fact that you will need technical skills in order to get it up and running. <br /></p>


<p>Note that you can easily find WordPress developers for a <a href="http://wpraken.io?ref=alkaweb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">reasonable cost.</a><br /></p>


<p>Then, you also need to take care of the maintenance and security of your application, although this is usually taken care of by the community.</p>


<p>There are Open-Source And Free Intranet Softwares. The easier way to bootstrap an intranet for free is to use <a href="https://buddypress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">BuddyPress</a> and build your own layer on top of it.</p>


<p>But there are also premium WordPress solutions that comes with better design and advanced features. </p>


<p>The main WordPress intranet solutions include:</p>


<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://woffice.io?ref=alkaweb" target="_blank">Woffice</a></li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Alliance (opens in a new tab)" href="http://themeforest.net/item/alliance-intranet-extranet-wordpress-theme/12087162?ref=alkaweb" target="_blank">Alliance</a></li><li><a href="http://themeforest.net/item/thrive-intranet-community-wordpress-theme/12275020?ref=alkaweb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Thrive</a></li></ul>

<p></p>


<p>Finally, on our plate are the free and open-source intranet solutions. <br /></p>


<p>They are not that many solutions available out-there. </p>


<h2>Wrap Up</h2>

There are other <a href="https://blog.thecrowdfundingformula.com/team-collaboration-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration tools</a> you can look at, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but intranet is this all-in-one solution you can easily start with.</p>

<p>Successful organizations choose to use an intranet. And there is a reason for that. Intranets offer <g class="gr_ gr_43 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="43" data-gr-id="43">a tons</g> of benefits.<br /></p>


<p>With the increasing number of applications and providers used, it is important for employees to be able to easily keep track of what’s happening in the organization. <br /></p>


<p>But what is an intranet? How is it different from an extranet? How can it benefit my organization? <br /></p>


<p>Without further ado, let’s get into that. <br /></p>


<span id="more-1039"></span>


<h2>What Is An Intranet?</h2>


<p>An intranet is a website or an application operating on the company network and which aims at gathering all the resources of the company in a single place. <br /></p>


<p>In simple terms, you could define it as a database with a beautiful user interface.<br /><br />By setting up an intranet for your company, you are clustering all the assets of your company, and, as a consequence, you turn your employees toward the same goal: make your company thrive.<br /></p>


<p>A very basic intranet could be made up of a simple shared folder connected to a network: all files in that folder will be visible to other intranet members (depending on their permissions). <br /></p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/unv9L2lW10qHrmWUYB7RxlM6q_kajqOfqZxU95Li8AsmmIE7s-BXjFTSt8jzU0hYpSp_dtXA3LcxYWkTsEdhAYi1tT6cvH75uKwSsl43nANNW0vXdT8sHpyLYeVYDhyrA6FQWcqT" alt="Intranet Dashboard"/><figcaption>Source : <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://unsplash.com﻿</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p><br />That’s being said, the benefits of such intranet would be very limited. The members would share files. They would not leverage any other productivity gain from internal messaging, project management, to task assignment and shared calendars.<br /><br />If you want to use these features, you need an expert to build a private website (or, possibly, a software system, but a website is much simpler). It doesn’t necessarily need to look cool but it has to work well with all the features requested. Due to the network setup, this website will be accessible only to intranet members.<br /><br /></p>


<p>Up to now, only large and medium-sized companies were using intranets because intranet (let alone extranet) used to be really expensive (<a href="https://www.exoplatform.com/blog/2016/05/04/estimate-your-companys-intranet-project-cost-in-7-steps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $200/month for a private network in 2014</a>).<br /><br />Nowadays, the price issue has been overcome, and companies are able to get a private space by spending way less money. <br /></p>


<p>The intranet market has expanded to smaller businesses and organizations with the increasing number of software providers and the accessibility of WordPress.<br /></p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Ar2J_ad2YXicmxemHIumzT5rWXzpG6JbQMOUzRdYJFrAJCSAOwJZrR0w6usUC-291V6bGAap6AfY7bkcEowj6pbjHIb2FcfBAbmsQBXe1TKj91PwHjprhwQOlNOXAyPw5zKcKBoA" alt="SaaS Market Growth"/><figcaption><a href="https://financesonline.com/2018-saas-industry-market-report-key-global-trends-growth-forecasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaaS Market Growth by FinancesOnline﻿</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p><br /></p>


<h3>Purpose Of An Intranet</h3>


<p>An intranet is put in use so that the organization’s employees improve task management and assignment processes, send alerts, communicate, share files and content easily, boost the social atmosphere of the company. <br /></p>


<p>It meant at improving the productivity of the team.</p>


<p>In the end, an intranet is a great way to improve the communication and the information shared inside a company. <br /></p>


<p>Better communication means better workflow: project deadlines are met faster, important files are at your service and easily accessible. <br /></p>


<p>On top of that, it can also decrease your expenses.</p>


<p>So, convinced by the benefits of such intranet?<br /><br /></p>


<h3>How Is An Extranet Different?<br /></h3>


<p>An extranet is conceptually the same thing but, technically, it is used when the members (in our case – company employees) are located in different places and cannot access the same local server. <br /></p>


<p>A simple example could be a company with offices in different cities. However, you can also use an extranet even if you are in the same building as <a href="https://www.sherweb.com/blog/total-cost-of-ownership-of-servers-iaas-vs-on-premise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web servers are way cheaper than private servers.<br /><br /></a></p>


<h2>Benefits Of An Intranet</h2>


<h3>Sharing Information</h3>


<p>All your users can now access and share facts with different permissions according to a defined role – which is relevant to their occupation or department. Thus, you also make sure that everyone in the company is on the same line: you won’t have any guy using the old logo, or the old branding. You are then improving the overall business efficiency.</p>


<h3>Curated Content And Saving Time<br /></h3>


<p>Owing to the number of changes and updates that tend to occur in your company, but also in your area, week-to-week information can become difficult to find. At Alkalab, we wanted to address this and create a single location where everyone would be able to find an answer to their question.<br /><br />That’s where the wiki base, or knowledge base, comes in: it allows any teammate – or the ones we want to be able &nbsp;–  to create a topic about something he stumbled across, or he simply knows about, and he wants to ensure that this “common” (or not so common) topic is now easily solvable.<br /><br />Therefore, in this case, your intranet provides you the ability to share resources and best practice between your employees, and so incentivise collaborative working. It can also act as a training platform if you publish online training content for example.<br /><br />Last but not least, when your guys run into an issue, as they are able to share the “hack”, overtime, you are raising the level of customer service: better access to accurate and consistent information by your staff.</p>


<h3>Reducing Costs</h3>


<p>As of now, you’ve seen that an intranet allows you to: share companies’ and clients’ information, store valuable resources, train your staff, ease collaboration and interaction ; but it also lets you manage project with, as far as we are concerned, a project management tool. It’s worth noting that you can, of course, add your custom or third-party integration.<br /><br />As a consequence, you’re reducing your costs by reducing the number of tools and licenses.<br /></p>


<h3>Better Communication</h3>


<p>What’s more, corporate information such as memos, handbooks, staff news and announcements can be disclosed in one place and store overtime.<br /><br />With the benefits being covered, we’re now convinced that an intranet is what we need. <br /></p>


<p>Building such an intranet would entail certain costs and take some time.<br /><br />Lucky us, we have found a cheap solution to build it: <a href="https://wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a>.</p>


<h2>Why Would You Choose WordPress For Your Intranet?</h2>


<p>WordPress is the most frequently used Content Management System (CMS) in the world. It was born for blogging – but nowadays it is so much more!<br /><br />● WordPress 26.4% of the web, <a href="https://wordpress.com/about/?aff=2718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to WordPress.com</a> and <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">w3techs<br /></a>● <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">62 translations of WordPress</a> are available<br />● WordPress is behind <a href="http://w3techs.com/blog/entry/wordpress-powers-25-percent-of-all-websites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30% of the top 1,000 websites<br /></a>● <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">54 000+ WordPress plugins</a> and growing daily.<br /><br />Besides those outstanding facts, WordPress provides a basis for your intranet and lets you customize it.<br /></p>


<p>A lot of features are already provided in <a href="https://alkalab.com/5-magnificent-multipurpose-wordpress-themes-for-building-stunning-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">themes or plugins</a>, and there are numerous <a href="https://alkalab.com/blog/best-wordpress-intranet-themes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">themes built for intranet and extranet. </a><br /></p>


<p>So, you just need to install a brand new theme and set it up. <br /></p>


<p>Furthermore, you can extend its features in a sec: you have 54K plugins available for you and you can easily <a href="https://alkalab.com/tutorial-create-a-wordpress-plugin-for-your-web-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create your own</a>, or call out for help from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="freelancers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://millo.co/freelance-job-sites" target="_blank">freelancers</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://wpkraken.io/?ref=alkaweb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="WordPress experts (opens in a new tab)">WordPress experts</a>.<br /></p>


<p>It offers you a lot of ways to improve your intranet: forum, cache, paid membership, slider, etc.</p>


<h3>Intranet Best Practices</h3>


<h4><strong>User profile and information</strong></h4>


<p>Every user can have his/her own page, where important (or less important) information, such as email, phone number, office number, team or group memberships, etc., can be displayed.<br /></p>


<h4><strong>Private messages</strong></h4>


<p>You can send messages to other members or groups.<br /></p>


<h4><strong>Create groups for members</strong></h4>


<p>Members can be grouped by work team, section or company department. Groups can also be used for more social purposes.<br /><br />Here, group membership roles can be managed: by making them visible to all or not, by allowing all members to request joining the group or not.<br /><br /></p>


<h4><strong>Internal blogging news<br /></strong></h4>


<p>Blog posts are, of course, in the core of <a href="https://alkalab.com/5-magnificent-multipurpose-wordpress-themes-for-building-stunning-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a>, so you can have a space for news, announcements and official communication available only to the members of your company.<br /></p>


<h4><strong>Project and task assignment</strong></h4>


<p>This is a very important feature, which can boost your performance. With the right theme or plugin, you can have a space for each project, where you can assign tasks to members, share documents, links or any pieces of information, publish comments or announcements for all members, keep track of progress using the task bar.<br /><br /></p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/W9r06dbRjWJH444IS2zCtp1wEI61ZQjDdQBpAt5Yxsq0-a4FG4Dw3etc4sT2ben1g1l-xR7OYtu-ptYuqeJ--riy1joOZHVyqs8K_fyka4_Obrlo6B0oWs-4IlMwkAMflOXjo03s" alt="

"/><figcaption>Woffice: all-in-one WordPress Intranet Theme<br /><br /></figcaption></figure></div>


<h4><strong>Calendar</strong></h4>


<p>Taskbar doesn’t require much explanation: you will have a calendar where all employees can see appointments, project deadlines, new events, etc.<br /></p>


<h4><strong>File sharing</strong><br /></h4>


<p>You can manage folders and subfolders, upload files that the employees have to use on a daily basis.<br /></p>


<h4><strong>Knowledge&nbsp;Base</strong></h4>


<p>Easily handle a wiki for basic information (something like the following image), including revisions, hierarchy, categories <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="6" data-gr-id="6">and</g> searches.<br /></p>


<h4><strong>Manage user membership across your app</strong></h4>


<p>You can assign different roles to members, with each role having its own permissions. Members with the right permissions will be able to edit pages, projects, wiki content, publish news and so on. <br /></p>


<p>Members can do everything from the FrontEnd – they will never see the WordPress dashboard and environment, so no need to be a WordPress expert.<br /><br />Finally, the last point that must be handled thoroughly, as for any WordPress website, is the security. We have shared the best practices when it comes to securing your WordPress website in this article.<br /><br />As I have already told, if you want your company’s intranet to enjoy good features, you need to use the right theme and plugins.</p>
