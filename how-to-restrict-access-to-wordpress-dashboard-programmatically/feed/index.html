Hello Bart,
Sorry for the delay here.
You can use a plugin like this one to achieve this: https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello,
Is it possible to limit backend access to one user on user ID or Username?
The particular user needs to be an admin for some kind of functionality, but i don&#039;t want him/her to have access to the backend.
Greetings Bart]]></description>

No, you need to create a new plugin, see the repository, which is linked at the beginning of the article. You should not edit any WordPress core file.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HI Antonio,
Thanks for the awesome sharing for the code.
&quot;Limit access to the admin panel only to certain roles &quot;
I try the code as above on my website and it works perfectly !
However I found a loophole which i need your advise.
The restriction works on Desktop.
I tried to login via my mobile( as a vendor role ), then go to xxx.com/admin ; i can view the Dashboard with all ADMIN functions ! ( Does Not Work on Mobile )
I am using woocommerce, and there&#039;s couple of roles.
I would like to restrict dashboard for all roles except admin and editor
Looking forward for your advise.
Thanks for the awesome work !]]></description>
