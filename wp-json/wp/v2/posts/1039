And there is a reason for that. Intranets offer <g class=\"gr_ gr_43 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"43\" data-gr-id=\"43\">a tons<\/g> of benefits.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>With the increasing number of applications and providers used, it is important for employees to be able to easily keep track of what\u2019s happening in the organization. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>But what is an intranet? How is it different from an extranet? How can it benefit my organization? <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Without further ado, let\u2019s get into that. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n<h2>What Is An Intranet?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>An intranet is a website or an application operating on the company network and which aims at gathering all the resources of the company in a single place. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>In simple terms, you could define it as a database with a beautiful user interface.<br \/><br \/>By setting up an intranet for your company, you are clustering all the assets of your company, and, as a consequence, you turn your employees toward the same goal: make your company thrive.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>A very basic intranet could be made up of a simple shared folder connected to a network: all files in that folder will be visible to other intranet members (depending on their permissions). <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/unv9L2lW10qHrmWUYB7RxlM6q_kajqOfqZxU95Li8AsmmIE7s-BXjFTSt8jzU0hYpSp_dtXA3LcxYWkTsEdhAYi1tT6cvH75uKwSsl43nANNW0vXdT8sHpyLYeVYDhyrA6FQWcqT\" alt=\"Intranet Dashboard\"\/><figcaption>Source : <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/unsplash.com\ufeff<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><br \/>That\u2019s being said, the benefits of such intranet would be very limited. The members would share files. They would not leverage any other productivity gain from internal messaging, project management, to task assignment and shared calendars.<br \/><br \/>If you want to use these features, you need an expert to build a private website (or, possibly, a software system, but a website is much simpler). It doesn\u2019t necessarily need to look cool but it has to work well with all the features requested. Due to the network setup, this website will be accessible only to intranet members.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Up to now, only large and medium-sized companies were using intranets because intranet (let alone extranet) used to be really expensive (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.exoplatform.com\/blog\/2016\/05\/04\/estimate-your-companys-intranet-project-cost-in-7-steps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than $200\/month for a private network in 2014<\/a>).<br \/><br \/>Nowadays, the price issue has been overcome, and companies are able to get a private space by spending way less money. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The intranet market has expanded to smaller businesses and organizations with the increasing number of software providers and the accessibility of WordPress.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/Ar2J_ad2YXicmxemHIumzT5rWXzpG6JbQMOUzRdYJFrAJCSAOwJZrR0w6usUC-291V6bGAap6AfY7bkcEowj6pbjHIb2FcfBAbmsQBXe1TKj91PwHjprhwQOlNOXAyPw5zKcKBoA\" alt=\"SaaS Market Growth\"\/><figcaption><a href=\"https:\/\/financesonline.com\/2018-saas-industry-market-report-key-global-trends-growth-forecasts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SaaS Market Growth by FinancesOnline\ufeff<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Purpose Of An Intranet<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>An intranet is put in use so that the organization\u2019s employees improve task management and assignment processes, send alerts, communicate, share files and content easily, boost the social atmosphere of the company. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>It meant at improving the productivity of the team.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>In the end, an intranet is a great way to improve the communication and the information shared inside a company. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Better communication means better workflow: project deadlines are met faster, important files are at your service and easily accessible. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>On top of that, it can also decrease your expenses.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>So, convinced by the benefits of such intranet?<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<h3>How Is An Extranet Different?<br \/><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>An extranet is conceptually the same thing but, technically, it is used when the members (in our case \u2013 company employees) are located in different places and cannot access the same local server. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>A simple example could be a company with offices in different cities. However, you can also use an extranet even if you are in the same building as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sherweb.com\/blog\/total-cost-of-ownership-of-servers-iaas-vs-on-premise\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">web servers are way cheaper than private servers.<br \/><br \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Benefits Of An Intranet<\/h2>\n\n\n<h3>Sharing Information<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>All your users can now access and share facts with different permissions according to a defined role \u2013 which is relevant to their occupation or department. Thus, you also make sure that everyone in the company is on the same line: you won\u2019t have any guy using the old logo, or the old branding. You are then improving the overall business efficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Curated Content And Saving Time<br \/><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Owing to the number of changes and updates that tend to occur in your company, but also in your area, week-to-week information can become difficult to find. At Alkalab, we wanted to address this and create a single location where everyone would be able to find an answer to their question.<br \/><br \/>That\u2019s where the wiki base, or knowledge base, comes in: it allows any teammate \u2013 or the ones we want to be able &nbsp;\u2013  to create a topic about something he stumbled across, or he simply knows about, and he wants to ensure that this \u201ccommon\u201d (or not so common) topic is now easily solvable.<br \/><br \/>Therefore, in this case, your intranet provides you the ability to share resources and best practice between your employees, and so incentivise collaborative working. It can also act as a training platform if you publish online training content for example.<br \/><br \/>Last but not least, when your guys run into an issue, as they are able to share the \u201chack\u201d, overtime, you are raising the level of customer service: better access to accurate and consistent information by your staff.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Reducing Costs<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>As of now, you\u2019ve seen that an intranet allows you to: share companies\u2019 and clients\u2019 information, store valuable resources, train your staff, ease collaboration and interaction ; but it also lets you manage project with, as far as we are concerned, a project management tool. It\u2019s worth noting that you can, of course, add your custom or third-party integration.<br \/><br \/>As a consequence, you\u2019re reducing your costs by reducing the number of tools and licenses.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Better Communication<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s more, corporate information such as memos, handbooks, staff news and announcements can be disclosed in one place and store overtime.<br \/><br \/>With the benefits being covered, we\u2019re now convinced that an intranet is what we need. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Building such an intranet would entail certain costs and take some time.<br \/><br \/>Lucky us, we have found a cheap solution to build it: <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Why Would You Choose WordPress For Your Intranet?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>WordPress is the most frequently used Content Management System (CMS) in the world.
