But how to find the best intranet software? <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>I have already covered the <a href=\"https:\/\/alkalab.com\/blog\/benefits-intranet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">benefits of using an intranet.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Today, I will give you an overview of the different possibilities when it comes to picking an intranet solution. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>This means that we will not only cover the different providers, but we will also cover the different types of intranet and extranet. &nbsp;<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Without further ado, let\u2019s get into the core of the matter. <\/p>\n\n\n<h2>What Are Intranet And Extranet?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>An intranet is a private space meant at improving the collaboration within your company. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>It usually features a chat system, a knowledge base, a blog section, an employee portal, and some more advanced HR features. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>An intranet plays different roles and faces different challenges depending on the size of the company, the type of company and the culture. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>To make things simpler, we then split out the intranet into different categories based on their goals and missions.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Intranets become more and more important as companies become more connected and become more remote-friendly. <\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/alkalab.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/image.png\" alt=\"State of Remote Work by Buffer\" class=\"wp-image-1091\"\/><figcaption>State of Remote Work by Buffer<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>As mentioned by Buffer in the <a href=\"https:\/\/open.buffer.com\/state-remote-work-2018\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">State of Remote Work<\/a>, there is an upward trend when it comes to letting employees work remotely. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>This means that employees need to find new and innovative ways to build <a href=\"https:\/\/visibly.io\/what-is-employee-advocacy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">employee advocacy<\/a> and involve them at every stage of the company. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>This is where the social intranet software comes in. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<h3>What Is a Social Intranet Software? <\/h3>\n\n\n<p>As simple as it sounds, a social <g class=\"gr_ gr_16 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar\" id=\"16\" data-gr-id=\"16\">intranet<\/g> improves the social engagement among the organization. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Think of it as a social network inside the application. It motivates employees to be more productive. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>A social intranet is simply an internal-facing web application where employees can easily contribute knowledge and communicate with each other to make work more efficient and effective.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>One of the most important features of such intranet is the chatting system. We want employees to help each other. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>But more than that, we want them to get to know each other. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Some companies even go as far as organizing virtual meetups every week, month or so. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"181: How to Manage Remote Teams\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qJUpPBhZHAU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n<p>In order to properly understand the whys of such social intranet, let\u2019s go back to the basics of what does \u201csocial\u201d mean. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The terms social refers to the interactions between humans. Social networking is the act of actually building relationships. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>We have come a long way since the beginning of social networking. It all started with people networking at the coffee machine. Then, the early days of social media software, and now more advanced social intranet software. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Engaging employees and nudging them to do more than \u201cworking\u201d for the company has positives results on the turnover. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>But it also springs up the reputation of the company and the attractiveness of the company. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/3SCHZtofMdD3yFV29aXSoCif2BlMGCQ0iodGO41EZvKVyz2QRUahNlsKdmXoJ6EWQ7oVihziye1uA3hIdjBik_c2nkdoo8QjKCxZVOwbVMP3-DP-7WRBT5KfkUp5e2ngOaoErbL5\" alt=\"Statistics about employee engagement by Gartner\ufeff\"\/><figcaption><a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.gartner.com\/marc-brown\/fuel-your-everyone-sells-culture-through-employee-advocacy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Statistics about employee engagement by Gartner\ufeff<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Which is what amount for such intranet: <\/p>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Engagement, connection, and interactions<\/strong>: all employees get to know each other and talk with each other<\/li><li><strong>Ownership and authorship: <\/strong>everyone can and is urged to participate in the conversation and contribute in its own way<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<p>All of that helps the employees build relationships.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/workplace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Workplace by Facebook<\/a> is a great example. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/cDm9wj5RCUcb-2QnxbJydMK4ng0uFia72-6VxxRLcQJeHT1wW2bZqSC_1Rv6ltNcVhisLnSSUUZFk8NOMq3dC7aRF39VhszTwlaRQuYMvgtSCqazF6VIqeKwulO2ENGnqOSx_yCM\" alt=\"Workplace By Facebook Intranet Software Example\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>More advanced social intranet software will also include <a href=\"https:\/\/feedier.com\/blog\/reasons-gamification-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">gamification<\/a> features in order to further empower employees and push them to engage.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>It could be the likes of giving points for the number of contributions or challenging employees based on their activity. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/axerosolutions.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Axero is a great example.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/gamipress.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"GamiPress (opens in a new tab)\">GamiPress<\/a> is also a great open-source solution.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>What Is an Employee Intranet Portal?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We have seen that social intranets are focused on building relationships among your employees and push them to engage. They make intranet and collaboration more fun.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, employee intranets are more standard forms of <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">intranets<\/g>. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>They mainly focus on providing HR functionalities, such as leave requests, expenses accounts, etc. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>According to a study by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prescientdigital.com\/downloads\/2012%20Social%20Intranet%20Study_Summary_Prescient%20Digital%20Media.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Prescient Digital<\/a>, while 80% of organizations have had intranets for a while, they were not used at their full potential. Most employees visit their intranet only about once a month and 75 percent use them solely for HR purposes. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The culprit? <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The lack of social interaction and the poor User Experience. <\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Communication and networking must be made easy. <\/strong><br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Which is why your intranet should have features from both world. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>All-in-all, your intranet should strip out all the useless features and focus on what\u2019s important for your company. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<h4>Intranet Features<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Some useful intranet features include: <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<ul><li>Social media features such as comment, like, Q&amp;A, FAQ, tag<\/li><li>Content sharing (video, images, resources) and knowledge base<\/li><li>Powerful search engine<\/li><li>Content collaboration, transparency, and history of collaboration<\/li><li>Role management, as well as access management<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<p>Do you need more employee engagement?

What is the best way to get it up and running?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Although some companies using an intranet still rely on a custom on-premise intranet, most companies are turning to the cloud today. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll walk you through the different cloud-based intranet solutions. <\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Different Cloud-Based Intranet Solutions<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>A study was conducted by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prescientdigital.com\/articles\/social-intranet-survey-2011\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Prescient Digital<\/a> a few years ago about the different solutions used by companies to power their intranet.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The results are very interesting and suggest that there is no rule-of-thumb when it comes to setting up an intranet. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/NkdyKoCfeEqxjdNGcZ9mppUk6jLH9vCnzPi6haYxxGJL6fmguk4-UpJkQ3D11xBf0tLnJy7YGMut1DRUoPFLF9Bzmvjk-2X_T7kTbuQKYC5LJheVrWuHJUVBK-e9ikdom5J-pdoR\" alt=\"What Types of Technology Powers Your Intranet\"\/><figcaption>What Types of Technology Powers Your Intranet<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Which makes my study even more interesting. <\/p>\n\n\n<h3>SaaS Intranets<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>To start off, let\u2019s talk about the Software as a Service (SaaS) intranet. The SaaS market is rapidly growing and expanding into all types of verticals. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p><em>\u201cThe global SaaS market has been predicted to expand at a CAGR of 19.9% between 2015 and 2022 and is forecasted to reach $71.2 billion in 2018 &#8211; a 21.5% increase from 2017.\u201d<\/em><br \/><\/p><cite><em> <\/em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/crozdesk.com\/software-research\/saas-and-cloud-market-predictions-2018\" target=\"_blank\">Crozdesk<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n<p>The intranet is one vertical. <\/p>\n\n\n<h4>SaaS Intranet Upsides<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost and ease-of-use<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The main benefits of using SaaS rely on the cost and ease of use. You usually don\u2019t need any technical skill to get the intranet up-and-running, which makes the barrier to entry very low. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Performances<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<p>They are also hosted by the provider, which means that you don\u2019t have to worry about performances and down-times (provided you choose a good solution ?).<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-coblocks-click-to-tweet\"><p class=\"wp-block-coblocks-click-to-tweet__text\"><em>Setting up an on-premise intranet used to take between 6 to 9 months.

How long will you use this for? You don\u2019t know. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Most SaaS providers offer monthly and yearly plans, which means that you can back out at any time if you decide to change. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<h4>SaaS Intranet Downsides<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Although you don\u2019t need to worry about performances and hosting, it also comes with its own set of downsides. First, if there is a bump in the usage of the software, you\u2019re likely to feel the pinch and get lower performances. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Then, there is also the lack of flexibility. SaaS providers offer you a ready-made software, more or less customisable. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Which means that if you have very specific requirements or edge-cases, you will either have to splash out, or find a very flexible solution. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The latter is usually less user-friendly and harder to get started with.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<h4>SaaS Intranet Providers<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m now going to cover the best intranet SaaS according to reviews on the Web and usage.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The first one on the list is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/workplace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Workplace By Facebook.<\/a> It is rated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.g2crowd.com\/products\/workplace-by-facebook\/reviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3.9\/5 on G2Crowd&nbsp;with&nbsp;~800&nbsp;r<\/a>eviews.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.intranetizen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/workplace-by-facebook-e1492717431251.jpg?fit=1050%2C424&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Workplace by Facebook \ufeff\"\/><figcaption><em>Workplace by Facebook \ufeff<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>The second one on our list is <a href=\"https:\/\/intranet.jostle.me\/saas-intranet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jostle<\/a>.

WordPress provides a framework for you to get started with, as well as some templates. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>You can then customize them and tailor them to your needs. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<h4>WordPress Intranet Upsides<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>First of all, WordPress intranets are usually way cheaper than SaaS providers. All you need is a server to run WordPress and host your intranet software. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Besides this, you can find a lot of <a href=\"https:\/\/alkalab.com\/blog\/wordpress-intranet-themes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">great<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/alkalab.com\/wordpress-intranet-themes\/]\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> boilerplates and WordPress Intranet themes to get started with.<\/a> So you will only need to install and customize!<\/p>\n\n\n<p>WordPress codebase will also be in your hand, and so does the WordPress theme files, which means that you can fully customize and extend the scope of your intranet.  <\/p>\n\n\n<p>WordPress\u2019s directory of 50K+ plugins will also help for extending the scope of your intranet. <\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/alkalab.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/image-1-1024x678.png\" alt=\"WordPress Intranet Upsides\" class=\"wp-image-1095\"\/><figcaption>WordPress Intranet Upsides<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h4>WordPress Intranet Downsides<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>It also comes with its set of inconvenient or barriers to entry.
