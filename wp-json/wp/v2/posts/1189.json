Connected, not connected. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>But here is the thing. You want your community to be engaged. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t want it to shade off on the side. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>How to go about it? <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>You can build Facebook Groups, Messenger or Slack communities. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>But you can also create a fully-fledged online application with more features than the usual posts\/comments.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>And lucky you, WordPress makes it easy to build such an application. You can find WordPress community themes that will help you spin up your application in a matter of minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>What is a WordPress Community Theme?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>First, let\u2019s get down to the basics: a definition. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>What is a WordPress community theme?<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Using_Themes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">codex<\/a>, here is the definition of a WordPress theme.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cA WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a weblog. These files are called template files. A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software. Themes may include customized template files, image files (*.jpg, *.gif), style sheets (*.css), custom Pages, as well as any necessary code files (*.php). For an introduction to template files, see Stepping Into Templates.\u201d<\/em><br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>There are very generic themes, that doesn\u2019t focus on one specific thing. Great examples are <a href=\"https:\/\/1.envato.market\/c\/1292040\/275988\/4415?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthemeforest.net%2Fitem%2Favada-responsive-multipurpose-theme%2F2833226%3Fs_rank%3D1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Avada<\/a> or <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/1.envato.market\/c\/1292040\/275988\/4415?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthemeforest.net%2Fitem%2Fstack-multipurpose-wordpress-theme-with-variant-page-builder%2F19707359\" target=\"_blank\">Stack<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/alkalab.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/avada.jpg\" alt=\"Avada WordPress theme\" class=\"wp-image-1192\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n<p>But there are also more specific themes that serve a specific niche or purpose. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Community themes are such an example. They have different features, integrations, and a design that fits online communities. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Most importantly, they work with the usual WordPress community plugins, the main one being <a href=\"https:\/\/buddypress.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">BuddyPress<\/a>.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Good. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>We know how to go about creating a quick and effective community. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>By fostering your community on a familiar platform such as WordPress you make it easy to start, but also easy to evolve and tailor. In fact, WordPress is <a href=\"https:\/\/wpnewsify.com\/wordpress\/state-wordpress-buddypress\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">powering more than 30%<\/a> of the web. Think up\u2026 there are tons of proficient developers out there. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The beauty? You keep and own your data. Everything is stored under your hood. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Moving on the choice of our WordPress template. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>How To Choose The Right WordPress Theme for Your Community?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Here are a few features you\u2019ll be looking for in your WordPress theme when making the call for it.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Design and Interface<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>First thing first. How attractive and modern the theme is? <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Do you remember this old page from Facebook?<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Lucky me, I don\u2019t. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Either way, I\u2019d be reluctant to use such a design.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Okay, I\u2019m going too far, exaggerating. But you get the point. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The design is timely, it was likely good for the time. But not good for today. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>So we want anything but something similar to this. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/alkalab.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/facebook.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1193\"\/><figcaption><em>Facebook in 2004\ufeff<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n<p>We want an attractive design that gives us the willpower. Something we want to use. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Something we feel easy to play with. We don\u2019t have to mock around for 20 minutes before finding what we want.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/alkalab.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/perfectionist-scale.jpg\" alt=\"Where does the theme lands on this scale? (Interaction-Design.org)\" class=\"wp-image-1194\"\/><figcaption><em>Where does the theme lands on this scale? (<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.interaction-design.org\/literature\/article\/the-design-perfectionist-s-checklist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Interaction-Design.org<\/em><\/a><em>)<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n<p>Pro tip: make sure to check the design on your laptop, but also on tablets and smartphones. You absolutely want the theme to be responsive. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Last, but not least, make sure that the theme loads fast. You don\u2019t want the page to hang for 2 minutes before displaying what it\u2019s supposed to. <\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Social and Members-Related Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We have an easy-to-use application. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>But we still haven\u2019t checked through our core features. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>We want to make a collaborative <a href=\"https:\/\/alkalab.com\/blog\/intranet-software\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">intranet<\/a>\/community site where our members can thrive.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>We want to bring together, at the least, the following features: <\/p>\n\n\n<ul><li>Social networking: whether we are talking about user profiles, activity posting, or any other social networking feature. It\u2019s a must to have some of those basics <\/li><li>Messaging: being able to communicate with other members privately, or using group chat is required as well. We want the chat to be efficient, secure, supporting files and text formatting. <\/li><li>Forums: debating, contributing, asking public questions; these are all must-have features of our community theme.<\/li><li>Events management: sharing the next community event must be as easy as logging in! That\u2019d be even better if our theme would support integrations with the major Calendar players (Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, Outlook). <\/li><li>File sharing: we would also want to be able to share files in private and public. This must be powerful enough to support different folders, so we can truly manage the files.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<p>Then, if we have e-commerce and even e-learning capabilities, that\u2019d be the icing on the cake.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.learndash.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">LearnDash<\/a> is one of the most prominent Learning Management System for WordPress. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/alkalab.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/learndash.jpg\" alt=\"Learndash for WordPress community\" class=\"wp-image-1195\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n<p>Before we dive into the comparison of the best themes out there. Let\u2019s clear up any confusion and clarify the difference between a social network solution, and a fully-featured community theme. <\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Social Network Themes for WordPress vs Community Theme vs Intranet Theme<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>As they sound, social network themes are focused on the interaction online. Networking online. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>They usually use the famous BuddyPress plugin under the hood and add their layer on top of it to make the social interaction more attractive. &nbsp;<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p><em>BuddyPress is a free plugin that helps you build any kind of community website using WordPress, with member profiles, activity streams, user groups, messaging, and more.<\/em><br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/alkalab.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/buddypress-1024x585.png\" alt=\"BuddyPress WordPress Community Plugin\" class=\"wp-image-1196\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n<p>Some of the common features include chat, groups, file sharing, commenting and posting. Think of it as a Facebook built using WordPress. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, community theme goes one step further and provide specific features meant at driving community engagement and interaction. Some examples include event management, member map, and member research tool, matchmaking, and much more. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Lastly, the <a href=\"https:\/\/alkalab.com\/wordpress-intranet-themes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">intranet themes<\/a> are meant at providing a business-oriented solution for organizations and teams to collaborate effectively. They not only offer social features but also all the business-related requirements to run an efficient project and team &#8211; such as project management, knowledge base, HR, etc. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<h2>WordPress Community Themes Compared<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>To wrap things up, we will be looking at the best community WordPress themes and look at how they compare. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Thrive WordPress Theme <\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The first item on our list is <a href=\"https:\/\/1.envato.market\/c\/1292040\/275988\/4415?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthemeforest.net%2Fitem%2Fthrive-intranet-community-wordpress-theme%2F12275020%3Fs_rank%3D1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Thrive<\/a>. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>It powers \u201ceverything you need to build a powerful intranet, extranet, and community\u201d. <br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Thrive is rated 4.38 based on 137 ratings, has been available since September 2015 and counts ~4K sales.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Woffice WordPress Theme <\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The next one on our list is <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/woffice.io?ref=alkaweb\" target=\"_blank\">Woffice.io<\/a>.
