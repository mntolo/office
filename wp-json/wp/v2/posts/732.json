On average,&nbsp;our customers triple the number of emails they collect when they implement email pop-ups.<\/li><li><strong>Collect feedback<\/strong>. On average,&nbsp;our customers notice a 5.1% feedback rate.<\/li><li><strong>Push a product or a service<\/strong>. You can expect a click-through-rate between 2%&nbsp;and 6% for this kind of pop-ups.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<p>In this article, we\u2019ll focus on the main use case: list-building.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Step 2: Define Your Segments<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Most webmasters create only one&nbsp;pop-up that they display on all pages of their website, no matter what.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s a huge mistake. Chances are your visitors are expecting something different from your website.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take the example of a WordPress blog dedicated to online marketing. The blog covers various themes: &nbsp;SEO, PPC, web design and entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Some of the visitors find the blog when searching for a SEO topic on Google.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Others come through a link to an article about PPC techniques that someone shared in a Slack channel, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>You get the idea, <em>right<\/em>?<\/p>\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s difficult to design a one-size-fits-all pop-up that will appeal to all these different kinds of visitors.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>So the first step is to think about your different segments. Personalization&nbsp;is key!<\/p>\n\n\n<p>You can define them in terms of:<\/p>\n\n\n<ul><li>Page visited<\/li><li>Category of page visited? (WordPress categories or WordPress tags)<\/li><li>Devices?<\/li><li>Traffic source?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a real-life example on WordPress-powered Skillcrush.com.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>When I exit a page in the \u201cRemote work\u201d category, I get this pop-up:<\/p>\n\n\n<p>But when I visit an article of the \u201cTech\u201d category, I get this one:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/alkalab.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/pasted-image-0-1-1024x683.png\" alt=\"Ultimate Guide WP Popup\" class=\"wp-image-723\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Defining different segments and displaying pop-ups tailored to them&nbsp;will help you display pop-ups that are most relevant to your audience.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><em>The result?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll end up collecting more emails.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Step 3: Identify Your Offer<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve got to tell you the truth.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><em>Most of your visitors won\u2019t subscribe to your newsletter just because you ask them<\/em>.

It all depends on what you need. Here are a few elements to take into consideration before making a decision.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Integrations<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re collecting emails, that\u2019s probably because you want to contact these people in the&nbsp;near future. <em>Right?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n<p>One of the first things to check when you choose a pop-up plug-in&nbsp;is whether it integrates with your email marketing solution or not.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>If not, it means you\u2019ll have to manually export and import your contacts. And trust me, this limits how soon you are able to contact your subscribers.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Targeting &amp; Design Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This could sound obvious, but it\u2019s not.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>There is&nbsp;a wide range of tools. <a href=\"https:\/\/wpbarista.com\/pop-up-window-in-wordpress\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">From tools where you need to create your design in HTML<\/a>&nbsp;and manually upload it, to tools that offer WYSIWYG design and advanced targeting.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Before choosing your pop-up maker, try to identify where the plug-in&nbsp;you\u2019re checking stands in that regard.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Pricing<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>There are almost as many pricing models as there are pop-up tools.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Beware of plug-ins&nbsp;that claim to be free.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>And if you go down the free plug-in&nbsp;road, prefer open-source tools.&nbsp;They\u2019ll limit the chances of&nbsp;introducing&nbsp;a security breach or ads in your website.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Wrap-Up<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s now up to you!<\/p>\n\n\n<p>If you appreciated this tutorial, share it.
