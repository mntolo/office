In one of those emails, you will find a download link. Download the plugin to your PC. After that, in your WordPress Dashboard, go to Plugins &gt; Add new &gt; Upload plugin \u2013 to upload and activate it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the plugin has been activated, you have to configure licence settings as shown in the image below (you can find your credentials in one of the emails that you have received):<\/span><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-114\" src=\"https:\/\/alka-web.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/learndash-license-settings.png\" alt=\"Learndash license settings\" width=\"650\" height=\"534\" \/><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, if you have decided to sell your courses, you have to fill in PayPal information:<\/span><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-115\" src=\"https:\/\/alka-web.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/learndash-payment-settings.png\" alt=\"learndash-payment-settings\" width=\"616\" height=\"568\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a new course<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can view the course as a container: inside the course, you can insert lessons, quizzes, assignments, and certificates.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before creating the content of your learning management system, I suggest you to familiarise yourself with the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/support.learndash.com\/articles\/best-practice\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best practices<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported by the authors of LearnDash (you can read the article only if you have logged in to the support area).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have already read it, or everything is clear to you, we can now create a Spanish Course.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, go to LearnDash LMS &gt; Course &gt; Add new, and enter a title and a description of your course.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, you have to fill in Course Options. Most of them are autoexplicative, so I will show you just a few less intuitive ones, like:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Course Materials<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This field accepts HTML markup, so you can fill it in this way:<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117\" src=\"https:\/\/alka-web.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Fotografia_dello_schermo_011116_025907_PM.jpg\" alt=\"Learndash: Course Materials\" width=\"835\" height=\"179\" \/><\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Course Price Type:<\/b>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Open:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The course is free, and users do not have to register in order to access it. This option \u200bcan also be used if you have decided to manage access to courses with a third party <a href=\"https:\/\/alka-web.com\/wp\/create-a-paid-memberships-area-on-your-wordpress-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">membership plugin<\/a>.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Free:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The course is free, but the user is required to register and log in to access the content.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Buy Now:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The user is required to purchase the course in order to access its content.

If you check this, the student will be able to open lessons and quizzes without taking care of the order.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think that LearnDash is the plugin that you are searching for, I would also recommend you <a href=\"http:\/\/themeforest.net\/item\/woffice-intranetextranet-wordpress-theme\/11671924&amp;ref=alkaweb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Woffice<\/a> \u2013 our WordPress theme for companies and educational institutions.
